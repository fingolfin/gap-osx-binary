  [33X[0;0YFiles  are identified by filenames, which are represented in [5XGAP[105X as strings.
  Filenames  can  be  created directly by the user or a program, but of course
  this is operating system dependent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFilenames  for  some  files  can  be constructed in a system independent way
  using  the  following  functions.  This is done by first getting a directory
  object for the directory the file shall reside in, and then constructing the
  filename. However, it is sometimes necessary to construct filenames of files
  in  subdirectories  relative  to  a given directory object. In this case the
  directory separator is [13Xalways[113X [10X/[110X even under DOS or MacOS.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSection  [14X9.3[114X describes how to construct directory objects for the common [5XGAP[105X
  and system directories. Using the command [2XFilename[102X ([14X9.4-1[114X) it is possible to
  construct a filename pointing to a file in these directories. There are also
  functions to test for accessibility of files, seeÂ [14X9.6[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.1 [33X[0;0YPortability[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  portability  filenames  and  directory names should be restricted to at
  most  8 alphanumerical characters optionally followed by a dot [10X.[110X and between
  1  and  3  alphanumerical  characters.  Upper case letters should be avoided
  because  some operating systems do not make any distinction between case, so
  that  [10XNaMe[110X,  [10XName[110X and [10Xname[110X all refer to the same file whereas some operating
  systems  are  case  sensitive.  To avoid problems only lower case characters
  should be used.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnother function which is system-dependent is [2XLastSystemError[102X ([14X9.1-1[114X).[133X
  
  [1X9.1-1 LastSystemError[101X
  
  [29X[2XLastSystemError[102X(  ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0Y[2XLastSystemError[102X  returns  a record describing the last system error that has
  occurred.  This  record  contains  at least the component [10Xmessage[110X which is a
  string.  This  message  is,  however,  highly operating system dependent and
  should only be used as an informational message for the user.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.2 [33X[0;0YGAP Root Directories[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  [5XGAP[105X  is  started it determines a list of directories which we call the
  [13X[5XGAP[105X  root  directories[113X.  In  a running [5XGAP[105X session this list can be found in
  [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  core  part  of  [5XGAP[105X  knows  which  files  to  read relative to its root
  directories.   For   example  when  [5XGAP[105X  wants  to  read  its  library  file
  [11Xlib/group.gd[111X,  it  appends this path to each path in [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[110X until
  it  finds  the  path  of  an existing file. The first file found this way is
  read.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,   [5XGAP[105X   looks   for   available   packages   by  examining  the
  subdirectories [11Xpkg/[111X in each of the directories in [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  root  directories  are  specified  via  one  or several of the [10X-l paths[110X
  command  line  options,  see  [14X3.1[114X. Furthermore, by default [5XGAP[105X automatically
  prepends a user specific [5XGAP[105X root directory to the list; this can be avoided
  by  calling [5XGAP[105X with the [10X-r[110X option. The name of this user specific directory
  depends  on  your  operating system, it can be found in [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X.
  This directory can be used to tell [5XGAP[105X about personal preferences, to always
  load  some  additional code, to install additional packages, or to overwrite
  some [5XGAP[105X files. See [14X3.2[114X for more information how to do this.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  special filename [10X"*stdin*"[110X denotes the standard input, i.e., the stream
  through  which  the  user  enters  commands  to  [5XGAP[105X. The exact behaviour of
  reading  from  [10X"*stdin*"[110X  is  operating  system  dependent,  but usually the
  following  happens. If [5XGAP[105X was started with no input redirection, statements
  are  read  from  the  terminal  stream until the user enters the end of file
  character,  which is usually [12XCtrl-D[112X. Note that terminal streams are special,
  in  that  they  may  yield  ordinary  input  [13Xafter[113X an end of file. Thus when
  control  returns to the main read-eval-print loop the user can continue with
  [5XGAP[105X.  If [5XGAP[105X was started with an input redirection, statements are read from
  the  current  position  in  the  input  file up to the end of the file. When

  return end of file, and [5XGAP[105X will terminate.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  special  filename  [10X"*errin*"[110X  denotes  the stream connected to the UNIX

  standard  input  was  redirected,  unless the standard error stream was also
  redirected, in which case opening of [10X"*errin*"[110X fails.[133X

  given as a string.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[2XRead[102X  first  opens the file [3Xname-file[103X. If the file does not exist, or if [5XGAP[105X
  cannot open it, e.g., because of access restrictions, an error is signalled.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThen  the  contents  of the file are read and evaluated, but the results are
  not  printed.  The  reading and evaluations happens exactly as described for
  the main loop (see [14X6.1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  a  statement  in  the  file  causes  an  error  a  break loop is entered
  (seeÂ [14X6.4[114X).  The  input  for  this break loop is not taken from the file, but
  from  the  input  connected  to  the  [10Xstderr[110X output of [5XGAP[105X. If [10Xstderr[110X is not
  connected  to  a  terminal,  no break loop is entered. If this break loop is
  left  with  [9Xquit[109X  (or [12XCtrl-D[112X), [5XGAP[105X exits from the [2XRead[102X command, and from all
  enclosing  [2XRead[102X  commands,  so  that  control  is  normally  returned  to an
  interactive  prompt.  The  [9XQUIT[109X  statement (seeÂ [14X6.7[114X) can also be used in the
  break loop to exit [5XGAP[105X immediately.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  a statement must not begin in one file and end in another. I.e.,
  [13Xeof[113X ([13Xe[113Xnd-[13Xo[113Xf-[13Xf[113Xile) is not treated as whitespace, but as a special symbol that

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  one  file may very well contain a read statement causing another

  [29X[2XREREADING[102X[32X global variable
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  general,  it is not possible to read the same [5XGAP[105X library file twice, or
  to  read  a  compiled  version  after reading a [5XGAP[105X version, because crucial
  global  variables  are  made read-only (see [14X4.9[114X) and filters and methods are
  added to global tables.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  partial  solution to this problem is provided by the function [2XReread[102X (and
  related  functions  [10XRereadLib[110X  etc.).  [10XReread(  [3Xname-file[103X[10X  )[110X sets the global
  variable  [2XREREADING[102X  to  [9Xtrue[109X,  reads  the  file named by [3Xname-file[103X and then
  resets [2XREREADING[102X. Various system functions behave differently when [2XREREADING[102X
  is  set  to [9Xtrue[109X. In particular, assignment to read-only global variables is
  permitted, calls to [2XNewRepresentation[102X ([14X79.2-1[114X) and [2XNewInfoClass[102X ([14X7.4-1[114X) with
  parameters  identical  to  those of an existing representation or info class
  will  return  the  existing object, and methods installed with [2XInstallMethod[102X
  ([14X78.2-1[114X) may sometimes displace existing methods.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  function  may not entirely produce the intended results, especially if
  what  has  changed  is  the  super-representation of a representation or the
  requirements  of a method. In these cases, it is necessary to restart [5XGAP[105X to
  read the modified file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  additional  use  of [2XReread[102X is to load the compiled version of a file for
  which  the  [5XGAP[105X  language  version  had previously been read (or perhaps was
  included in a saved workspace). See [14X76.3-9[114X and [14X3.3[114X for more information.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  not advisable to use [2XReread[102X programmatically. For example, if a file
  that  contains  calls  to  [2XReread[102X  is read with [2XReread[102X then [2XREREADING[102X may be
  reset too early.[133X
