  [33X[0;0YThis chapter explains how [5XGAP[105X decides which function to call for which types
  of  objects.  It  assumes  that  you  have  read  the chapters about objects
  (ChapterÂ [14X12[114X) and types (ChapterÂ [14X13[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  [13Xoperation[113X is a special [5XGAP[105X function that bundles a set of functions, its
  [13Xmethods[113X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  methods  of  an  operation  compute the same result. But each method is
  installed for specific types of arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  an  operation is called with a tuple of arguments, one of the applicable
  methods is selected and called.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSpecial cases of methods are partial methods, immediate methods, and logical
  implications.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.1 [33X[0;0YOperations and Methods[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YOperations are functions in the category [2XIsOperation[102X ([14X5.4-2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo  on  the  one  hand,  [13Xoperations[113X  are [5XGAP[105X functions, that is, they can be
  applied to arguments and return a result or cause a side-effect.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOn  the other hand, operations are more. Namely, an operation corresponds to
  a set of [5XGAP[105X functions, called the [13Xmethods[113X of the operation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach  call  of an operation causes a suitable method to be selected and then
  called.  The choice of which method to select is made according to the types
  of  the  arguments,  the  underlying mechanism is described in the following
  sections.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YExamples  of  operations  are  the  binary  infix  operators  [10X=[110X, [10X+[110X etc., and
  [2XPrintObj[102X  ([14X6.3-5[114X) is the operation that is called for each argument of [2XPrint[102X
  ([14X6.3-4[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlso  all  attributes  and  properties  are operations. Each attribute has a
  special  method  which  is  called if the attribute value is already stored;
  this method of course simply returns this value.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe setter of an attribute is called automatically if an attribute value has
  been  computed.  Attribute  setters are operations, too. They have a default
  method that ignores the request to store the value. Depending on the type of
  the  object,  there  may  be another method to store the value in a suitable
  way, and then set the attribute tester for the object to [9Xtrue[109X.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.2 [33X[0;0YMethod Installation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order  to  describe what it means to select a method of an operation, we
  must describe how the methods are connected to their operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor attributes and properties there is [2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X ([14X78.6-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor   declaring  that  a  filter  is  implied  by  other  filters  there  is
  [2XInstallTrueMethod[102X ([14X78.7-1[114X).[133X
  
  [1X78.2-1 InstallMethod[101X
  
  [29X[2XInstallMethod[102X( [3Xopr[103X[, [3Xinfo[103X][, [3Xfamp[103X], [3Xargs-filts[103X[, [3Xval[103X], [3Xmethod[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0Yinstalls  a  function method [3Xmethod[103X for the operation [3Xopr[103X; [3Xargs-filts[103X should
  be  a  list of requirements for the arguments, each entry being a filter; if
  supplied  [3Xinfo[103X  should  be a short but informative string that describes for
  what  situation  the  method  is  installed, [3Xfamp[103X should be a function to be
  applied  to the families of the arguments, and [3Xval[103X should be an integer that
  measures the priority of the method.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  default  values  for  [3Xinfo[103X,  [3Xfamp[103X,  and  [3Xval[103X  are the empty string, the
  function [2XReturnTrue[102X ([14X5.3-1[114X), and the integer zero, respectively.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe exact meaning of the arguments [3Xfamp[103X, [3Xargs-filts[103X, and [3Xval[103X is explained in
  SectionÂ [14X78.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[3Xopr[103X  expects its methods to require certain filters for their arguments. For
  example,  the  argument of a method for the operation [2XZero[102X ([14X31.10-3[114X) must be
  in  the  category [2XIsAdditiveElementWithZero[102X ([14X31.14-5[114X). It is not possible to
  use [2XInstallMethod[102X to install a method for which the entries of [3Xargs-filts[103X do
  not  imply the respective requirements of the operation [3Xopr[103X. If one wants to
  override  this  restriction,  one  has  to  use  [2XInstallOtherMethod[102X ([14X78.2-2[114X)
  instead.[133X
  
  [1X78.2-2 InstallOtherMethod[101X
  
  [29X[2XInstallOtherMethod[102X( [3Xopr[103X[, [3Xinfo[103X][, [3Xfamp[103X], [3Xargs-filts[103X[, [3Xval[103X], [3Xmethod[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0Yinstalls  a function method [3Xmethod[103X for the operation [3Xopr[103X, in the same way as
  for  [2XInstallMethod[102X  ([14X78.2-1[114X), but without the restriction that the number of
  arguments  must  match a declaration of [3Xopr[103X and without the restriction that
  [3Xargs-filts[103X imply the respective requirements of the operation [3Xopr[103X.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.3 [33X[0;0YApplicable Methods and Method Selection[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  method  installed  as  above  is [13Xapplicable[113X for an arguments tuple if the
  following conditions are satisfied.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  number  of arguments equals the length of the list [3Xargs-filts[103X, the [22Xi[122X-th
  argument  lies  in  the  filter  [3Xargs-filts[103X[22X[i][122X,  and  [3Xfamp[103X returns [9Xtrue[109X when
  applied  to  the  families of the arguments. The maximal number of arguments
  supported  for  methods  is  six,  one gets an error message if one tries to
  install a method with at least seven arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo  [3Xargs-filt[103X  describes  conditions for each argument, and [3Xfamp[103X describes a
  relation between the arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  unary  operations  such  as attributes and properties, there is no such
  relation  to  postulate,  [3Xfamp[103X is [2XReturnTrue[102X ([14X5.3-1[114X) for these operations, a
  function that always returns [9Xtrue[109X. For binary operations, the usual value of
  [3Xfamp[103X is [2XIsIdenticalObj[102X ([14X12.5-1[114X), which means that both arguments must lie in
  the same family.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  any  properties which occur among the filters in the filter list
  will  [13Xnot[113X be tested by the method selection if they are not yet known. (More
  exact:  if  [3Xprop[103X  is a property then the filter implicitly uses not [3Xprop[103X but
  [10XHas[3Xprop[103X[10X  and  [3Xprop[103X[10X[110X.)  If  this is desired you must explicitly enforce a test
  (see sectionÂ [14X78.5[114X) below.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf no method is applicable, the error message [21Xno method found[121X is signaled.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOtherwise,  the  applicable  method  with  highest [13Xrank[113X is selected and then
  called.  This  rank  is  given by the sum of the ranks of the filters in the
  list  [3Xargs-filt[103X, [13Xincluding involved filters[113X, plus the number [3Xval[103X used in the
  call of [2XInstallMethod[102X ([14X78.2-1[114X). So the argument [3Xval[103X can be used to raise the
  priority of a method relative to other methods for [3Xopr[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  from the applicable methods, an efficient one shall be selected.
  This  is  a  method  that  needs  only  little  time  and  storage  for  the
  computations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  seems to be impossible for [5XGAP[105X to select an optimal method in all cases.
  The  present  ranking  of  methods  is based on the assumption that a method
  installed  for  a special situation shall be preferred to a method installed
  for a more general situation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor example, a method for computing a Sylow subgroup of a nilpotent group is
  expected  to  be  more  efficient than a method for arbitrary groups. So the
  more  specific  method will be selected if [5XGAP[105X knows that the group given as
  argument is nilpotent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf  course  there  is  no  obvious  way  to decide between the efficiency of
  incommensurable  methods. For example, take an operation with one method for
  permutation  groups,  another method for nilpotent groups, but no method for
  nilpotent  permutation  groups,  and  call this operation with a permutation
  group known to be nilpotent.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.4 [33X[0;0YPartial Methods[133X[101X
  
  [1X78.4-1 TryNextMethod[101X
  
  [29X[2XTryNextMethod[102X(  ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  a  method has been selected and called, the method may recognize that
  it   cannot   compute   the   desired   result,   and  give  up  by  calling
  [10XTryNextMethod()[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  effect,  the  execution  of  the  method  is  terminated, and the method
  selection  calls  the  next  method  that  is applicable w.r.t. the original
  arguments.  In  other  words,  the  applicable  method  is  called  that  is
  subsequent  to  the  one  that called [2XTryNextMethod[102X, according to decreasing
  rank of the methods.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  example,  since  every  finite  group of odd order is solvable, one may
  install  a  method  for  the  property [2XIsSolvableGroup[102X ([14X39.15-6[114X) that checks
  whether  the size of the argument is an odd integer, returns [9Xtrue[109X if so, and
  gives up otherwise.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YCare  is  needed  if  a  partial  method might modify the type of one of its
  arguments,  for  example  by  computing  an  attribute  or property. If this
  happens,  and  the  type has really changed, then the method should not exit
  using  [10XTryNextMethod()[110X  but  should  call  the  operation  again, as the new
  information   in   the   type  may  cause  some  methods  previously  judged
  inapplicable  to  be  applicable.  For  example,  if  the  above  method for
  [2XIsSolvableGroup[102X  ([14X39.15-6[114X)  actually  computes  the  size, (rather than just
  examining  a  stored size), then it must take care to check whether the type
  of the group has changed.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.5 [33X[0;0YRedispatching[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs mentioned above the method selection will not test unknown properties. In
  situations,  in  which  algorithms  are  only  known  (or implemented) under
  certain conditions, however such a test might be actually desired.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne  way  to  achieve  this  would  be  to  install  the method under weaker
  conditions   and   explicitly   test   the  properties  first,  exiting  via
  [2XTryNextMethod[102X  ([14X78.4-1[114X) if some of them are not fulfilled. A problem of this
  approach  however  is  that such methods then automatically are ranked lower
  and that the code does not look nice.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  much  better  way is to use redispatching: Before deciding that no method
  has  been  found  one tests these properties and if they turn out to be true
  the method selection is started anew (and will then find a method).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis can be achieved via the following function:[133X
  
  [1X78.5-1 RedispatchOnCondition[101X
  
  [29X[2XRedispatchOnCondition[102X( [3Xoper[103X, [3Xfampred[103X, [3Xreqs[103X, [3Xcond[103X, [3Xval[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  function installs a method for the operation [3Xoper[103X under the conditions
  [3Xfampred[103X  and  [3Xreqs[103X  which  has absolute value [3Xval[103X; that is, the value of the
  filters  [3Xreqs[103X  is  disregarded.  [3Xcond[103X  is  a list of filters. If not all the
  values  of properties involved in these filters are already known for actual
  arguments  of  the  method,  they  are  explicitly  tested  and  if they are
  fulfilled  [13Xand[113X  stored  after  this test, the operation is dispatched again.
  Otherwise  the method exits with [2XTryNextMethod[102X ([14X78.4-1[114X). This can be used to
  enforce tests like [2XIsFinite[102X ([14X30.4-2[114X) in situations when all existing methods
  require  this property. The list [3Xcond[103X may have unbound entries in which case
  the corresponding argument is ignored for further tests.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.6 [33X[0;0YImmediate Methods[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsually a method is called only if its operation has been called and if this
  method has been selected, see [2XInstallMethod[102X ([14X78.2-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor attributes and properties, one can install also [13Ximmediate methods[113X.[133X
  
  [1X78.6-1 InstallImmediateMethod[101X
  
  [29X[2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X( [3Xopr[103X[, [3Xinfo[103X], [3Xfilter[103X, [3Xrank[103X, [3Xmethod[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0Y[2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X installs [3Xmethod[103X as an immediate method for [3Xopr[103X, which
  must  be  an attribute or a property, with requirement [3Xfilter[103X and rank [3Xrank[103X.
  The rank must be an integer value that measures the priority of [3Xmethod[103X among
  the  immediate  methods  for  [3Xopr[103X.  If  supplied, [3Xinfo[103X should be a short but
  informative  string  that  describes  the  situation  in which the method is
  called.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  immediate  method  is called automatically as soon as the object lies in
  [3Xfilter[103X,  provided  that the value is not yet known. Afterwards the attribute
  setter  is  called  in order to store the value, unless the method exits via
  [2XTryNextMethod[102X ([14X78.4-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  the  difference  to  [2XInstallMethod[102X  ([14X78.2-1[114X)  that no family predicate
  occurs  because [3Xopr[103X expects only one argument, and that [3Xfilter[103X is not a list
  of requirements but the argument requirement itself.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YImmediate methods are thought of as a possibility for objects to gain useful
  knowledge.  They  must  not  be  used  to  force  the  storing  of  [21Xdefining
  information[121X  in  an  object.  In  other  words,  [5XGAP[105X should work even if all
  immediate   methods   are   completely  disabled.  Therefore,  the  call  to
  [2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X  installs  [3Xmethod[103X  also as an ordinary method for [3Xopr[103X
  with requirement [3Xfilter[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  in  such  a case [5XGAP[105X executes a computation for which it was not
  explicitly  asked  by  the user. So one should install only those methods as
  immediate  methods  that  are  [13Xextremely cheap[113X. To emphasize this, immediate
  methods  are  also  called  [13Xzero  cost methods[113X. The time for their execution
  should really be approximately zero.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor example, the size of a permutation group can be computed very cheaply if
  a  stabilizer chain of the group is known. So it is reasonable to install an
  immediate method for [2XSize[102X ([14X30.4-6[114X) with requirement [10XIsGroup and Tester( [3Xstab[103X[10X
  )[110X, where [3Xstab[103X is the attribute corresponding to the stabilizer chain.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnother  example  would  be  the implementation of the conclusion that every
  finite  group  of  prime  power  order  is  nilpotent. This could be done by
  installing  an immediate method for the attribute [2XIsNilpotentGroup[102X ([14X39.15-3[114X)
  with  requirement  [10XIsGroup  and Tester( Size )[110X. This method would then check
  whether  the  size  is  a  finite  prime power, return [9Xtrue[109X in this case and
  otherwise  call  [2XTryNextMethod[102X  ([14X78.4-1[114X).  But this requires factoring of an
  integer,  which  cannot  be  guaranteed  to be very cheap, so one should not
  install this method as an immediate method.[133X
  
  
  [1X78.7 [33X[0;0YLogical Implications[133X[101X
  
  [1X78.7-1 InstallTrueMethod[101X
  
  [29X[2XInstallTrueMethod[102X( [3Xnewfil[103X, [3Xfilt[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  may happen that a filter [3Xnewfil[103X shall be implied by another filter [3Xfilt[103X,
  which  is usually a meet of other properties, or the meet of some properties
  and  some  categories.  Such  a  logical  implication can be installed as an
  [21Ximmediate method[121X for [3Xnewfil[103X that requires [3Xfilt[103X and that always returns [9Xtrue[109X.
  (This   should   not   be   mixed   up   with   the  methods  installed  via
  [2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X  ([14X78.6-1[114X), which have to be called at runtime for the
  actual objects.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[2XInstallTrueMethod[102X  has  the  effect that [3Xnewfil[103X becomes an implied filter of
  [3Xfilt[103X, seeÂ [14X13.2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  example,  each  cyclic  group  is  abelian, each finite vector space is
  finite  dimensional,  and each division ring is integral. The first of these
  implications is installed as follows.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[28XInstallTrueMethod( IsCommutative, IsGroup and IsCyclic );[128X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YContrary  to  the  immediate  methods  installed with [2XInstallImmediateMethod[102X
  ([14X78.6-1[114X), logical implications cannot be switched off. This means that after
  the  above  implication  has  been  installed, one can rely on the fact that
  every  object  in the filter [10XIsGroup and IsCyclic[110X will also be in the filter
  [2XIsCommutative[102X ([14X35.4-9[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X78.8 [33X[0;0YOperations and Mathematical Terms[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsually  an operation stands for a mathematical concept, and the name of the
  operation  describes  this  uniquely.  Examples  are  the  property [2XIsFinite[102X
  ([14X30.4-2[114X) and the attribute [2XSize[102X ([14X30.4-6[114X). But there are cases where the same
  mathematical  term  is used to denote different concepts, for example [10XDegree[110X
  is  defined  for polynomials, group characters, and permutation actions, and
  [10XRank[110X  is  defined  for  matrices,  free  modules,  [22Xp[122X-groups,  and transitive
  permutation actions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  in principle possible to install methods for the operation [10XRank[110X that
  are  applicable  to  the  different types of arguments, corresponding to the
  different  contexts.  But this is not the approach taken in the [5XGAP[105X library.
  Instead  there  are  operations  such  as  [2XRankMat[102X ([14X24.7-1[114X) for matrices and
  [2XDegreeOfCharacter[102X   ([14X72.8-4[114X)  (in  fact  these  are  attributes)  which  are
  installed as methods of the [21Xambiguous[121X operations [10XRank[110X and [10XDegree[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe idea is to distinguish between on the one hand different ways to compute
  the  same  thing  (e.g.Â different  methods  for [2X\=[102X ([14X31.11-1[114X), [2XSize[102X ([14X30.4-6[114X),
  etc.),  and on the other hand genuinely different things (such as the degree
  of a polynomial and a permutation action).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  former is the basic purpose of operations and attributes. The latter is
  provided  as a user convenience where mathematical usage forces it on us [13Xand[113X
  where  no conflicts arise. In programming the library, we use the underlying
  mathematically  precise  operations  or attributes, such as [2XRankMat[102X ([14X24.7-1[114X)
  and  [10XRankOperation[110X.  These should be attributes if appropriate, and the only
  role of the operation [10XRank[110X is to decide which attribute the user meant. That
  way,  stored  information  is stored with [21Xfull mathematical precision[121X and is
  less likely to be retrieved for a wrong purpose later.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne  word  about  possible  conflicts. A typical example is the mathematical
  term  [21Xcentre[121X,  which  is  defined as [22X{ x â M | a * x = x * a â a â M }[122X for a
  magma  [22XM[122X,  and as [22X{ x â L | l * x = 0 â l â L }[122X for a Lie algebra [22XL[122X. Here it
  is  [13Xnot[113X possible to introduce an operation [2XCentre[102X ([14X35.4-5[114X) that delegates to
  attributes  [10XCentreOfMagma[110X  and  [10XCentreOfLieAlgebra[110X, depending on the type of
  the  argument.  This  is  because any Lie algebra in [5XGAP[105X is also a magma, so
  both  [10XCentreOfMagma[110X  and  [10XCentreOfLieAlgebra[110X  would  be  defined  for  a Lie
  algebra,  with  different meaning if the characteristic is two. So we cannot
  achieve  that  one  operation  in  [5XGAP[105X  corresponds to the mathematical term
  [21Xcentre[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[21XAmbiguous[121X  operations  such  as  [10XRank[110X  are  declared  in  the  library  file
  [11Xlib/overload.g[111X.[133X
