  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  informs  about  command  line options for [5XGAP[105X (see [14X3.1[114X), some
  files in user specific [5XGAP[105X root directory (see [14X3.2[114X) and saving and loading a
  [5XGAP[105X workspace (see [14X3.3[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X3.1 [33X[0;0YCommand Line Options[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  you  start  [5XGAP[105X from a command line or from a script you may specify a
  number  of  options  on  the command-line to change the default behaviour of
  [5XGAP[105X.  All  these options start with a hyphen [10X-[110X, followed by a single letter.
  Options  must  not  be  grouped,  e.g.,  [10Xgap  -gq[110X  is invalid, use [10Xgap -g -q[110X
  instead.  Some  options require an argument, this must follow the option and
  must be separated by whitespace, e.g., [10Xgap -m 256m[110X, it is not correct to say
  [10Xgap -m256m[110X instead. Certain Boolean options ([10X-b[110X, [10X-q[110X, [10X-e[110X, [10X-r[110X, [10X-A[110X, [10X-D[110X, [10X-M[110X, [10X-T[110X,
  [10X-X[110X,  [10X-Y[110X) toggle the current value so that [10Xgap -b -b[110X is equivalent to [10Xgap[110X and
  to [10Xgap -b -q -b -q[110X etc.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X for UNIX will distinguish between upper and lower case options.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  described  in the [5XGAP[105X installation instructions (see the [11XINSTALL[111X file in
  the  [5XGAP[105X  root directory, or at [7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org/Download/INSTALL[107X),
  usually  you  will not execute [5XGAP[105X directly. Instead you will call a (shell)
  script, with the name [10Xgap[110X, which in turn executes [5XGAP[105X. This script sets some
  options which are necessary to make [5XGAP[105X work on your system. This means that
  the default settings mentioned below may not be what you experience when you
  execute [5XGAP[105X on your system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDuring  a  [5XGAP[105X  session,  one  can  find  the current values of command line
  options  in  the  record  [10XGAPInfo.CommandLineOptions[110X  (see [2XGAPInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X)),
  whose component names are the command line options (without the leading [10X-[110X).[133X

        [33X[0;6YBy  default,  some  needed  and  suggested  [5XGAP[105X  packages (see [14X76[114X) are
        loaded,  if  present, into the [5XGAP[105X session when it starts. This option
        disables  (actually  toggles) the loading of suggested packages, which
        can be useful for debugging or testing. The needed packages (and their
        needed packages, and so on) are loaded in any case.[133X

  [10X-a [110X[3Xmemory[103X[108X
        [33X[0;6YGASMAN,  the  storage manager of [5XGAP[105X uses [10Xsbrk[110X to get blocks of memory
        from  (certain)  operating  systems and it is required that subsequent
        calls  to  [10Xsbrk[110X produce adjacent blocks of memory in this case because
        [5XGAP[105X  only  wants  to  deal  with  one  large block of memory. If the C
        function  [10Xmalloc[110X is called for whatever reason, it is likely that [10Xsbrk[110X
        will  no  longer  produce  adjacent blocks, therefore [5XGAP[105X does not use
        [10Xmalloc[110X itself.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YHowever  some  operating  systems insist on calling [10Xmalloc[110X to create a
        buffer  when  a  file is opened, or for some other reason. In order to
        catch these cases [5XGAP[105X preallocates a block of memory with [10Xmalloc[110X which
        is  immediately  freed. The amount preallocated can be controlled with
        the [10X-a[110X option. (Most users do not need this option.)[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe option argument [3Xmemory[103X is specified as with the [10X-m[110X option.[133X

        kept  in a subdirectory of the [11Xbin[111X directory within the [5XGAP[105X or package
        root directory. The subdirectory name is determined from the operating
        system, processor and compiler details when [5XGAP[105X (resp. the package) is
        installed.  Under  rare circumstances, it may be necessary to override
        this name, and this can be done using the [10X-B[110X option.[133X

  [10X-l [110X[3Xpath_list[103X[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan be used to set or modify [5XGAP[105X's list of root directories (see [14X9.2[114X).
        The  default  if  no  [10X-l [110X option is given is the current directory [11X./[111X.
        This  option  can  be used several times. Depending on the [10X-r[110X option a
        further   user  specific  path  is  prepended  to  the  list  of  root
        directories (the path in [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y[3Xpath_list[103X  should be a list of directories separated by semicolons. No
        whitespace is permitted before or after a semicolon. If [3Xpath_list[103X does
        not  start  or  end  with  a  semicolon,  then  [3Xpath_list[103X replaces the
        existing  list  of  root  directories.  If  [3Xpath_list[103X  starts  with  a
        semicolon,  then  [3Xpath_list[103X  is  appended to the existing list of root
        directories.  If  [3Xpath_list[103X  ends  with a semicolon and does not start
        with  one,  then the new list of root directories is the concatenation
        of  [3Xpath_list[103X and the existing list of root directories. After [5XGAP[105X has
        completed  its  startup procedure and displays the prompt, the list of
        root  directories  can  be seen in the variable [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[110X, see
        [2XGAPInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YUsually  this  option is used inside a startup script to specify where
        [5XGAP[105X  is  installed  on  the  system. The [10X-l[110X option can also be used by
        individual  users  to tell [5XGAP[105X about privately installed modifications
        of  the  library,  additional  [5XGAP[105X  packages  and  so  on. Section [14X9.2[114X
        explains how several root paths can be used to do this.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y[5XGAP[105X  will  attempt to read the file [3Xroot_dir[103X[11X/lib/init.g[111X during startup
        where  [3Xroot_dir[103X  is  one  of  the  directories  in  its  list  of root
        directories.  If  [5XGAP[105X  cannot  find  its [11Xinit.g[111X file it will print the

        [33X[0;6YThis  amount  of memory should be large enough so that computations do

  [1X3.2 [33X[0;0YThe gap.ini and gaprc files[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  you  start [5XGAP[105X, it looks for files with the names [11Xgap.ini[111X and [11Xgaprc[111X in
  its  root  directories  (see [14X9.2[114X), and reads the first [11Xgap.ini[111X and the first
  [11Xgaprc[111X  file  it  finds. These files are used for certain initializations, as
  follows.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  file  [11Xgap.ini[111X  is  read  early  in  the startup process. Therefore, the
  parameters set in this file can influence the startup process, such as which
  packages  are  automatically  loaded  (see [2XLoadPackage[102X ([14X76.2-1[114X)) and whether
  library  files  containing  obsolete variables are read (see Chapter [14X77[114X). On
  the  other hand, only calls to a restricted set of [5XGAP[105X functions are allowed
  in   a   [11Xgap.ini[111X   file.   Usually,   it   should   only  contain  calls  of
  [2XSetUserPreference[102X  ([14X3.2-3[114X).  This file can be generated (or updated when new
  releases    introduce   further   user   preferences)   with   the   command
  [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X  ([14X3.2-3[114X). This file is read whenever [5XGAP[105X is started, with or
  without a workspace.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  file  [11Xgaprc[111X  is  read after the startup process, before the first input
  file  given  on  the  command  line  (see [14X3.1[114X). So the contents of this file
  cannot  influence  the startup process, but all [5XGAP[105X library functions can be
  called  in  this file. When [5XGAP[105X is started with a workspace then the file is
  read  only  if no [11Xgaprc[111X file had been read before the workspace was created.
  (With this setup, it is on the one hand possible that administrators provide
  a  [5XGAP[105X  workspace  for several users such that the user's [11Xgaprc[111X file is read
  when  [5XGAP[105X is started with the workspace, and on the other hand one can start
  [5XGAP[105X,  read  one's  [11Xgaprc[111X  file,  save  a workspace, and then start from this
  workspace [13Xwithout[113X reading one's [11Xgaprc[111X file again.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote   that   by   default,   the   user   specific   [5XGAP[105X   root   directory
  [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X  is  the  first  [5XGAP[105X root directory. So you can put your
  [11Xgap.ini[111X and [11Xgaprc[111X files into this directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  mechanism substitutes the much less flexible reading of a users [11X.gaprc[111X
  file  in  versions  of  [5XGAP[105X up to 4.4. For compatibility this [11X.gaprc[111X file is
  still read if the directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X does not exist, see [14X77.5[114X how

  [5XGAP[105X are read, and before the implementation parts of [5XGAP[105X and of the packages
  are read.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   file  [11Xgap.ini[111X  is  expected  to  consist  of  calls  to  the  function

  [33X[0;0YSince  the  file  [11Xgap.ini[111X  is  read before the implementation part of [5XGAP[105X is
  read,  not  all  [5XGAP[105X  functions  may  be  called in the file. Assignments of
  numbers,  lists,  and  records  are  admissible  as  well  as calls to basic
  functions  such  as  [2XConcatenation[102X  ([14X21.20-1[114X)  and  [2XJoinStringsWithSeparator[102X

  the  files mentioned on the command line are read. You can use this file for
  your  private  customizations. (Many users may be happy with using just user
  preferences  in the [11Xgap.ini[111X file (see above) for private customization.) For
  example,  if  you  have  a file containing functions or data that you always
  need,  you  could  read this from [11Xgaprc[111X. Or if you find some of the names in
  the  library  too  long,  you  could define abbreviations for those names in
  [11Xgaprc[111X. The following sample [11Xgaprc[111X file does both.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that only one [11Xgaprc[111X file is read when [5XGAP[105X is started. When a workspace
  is  created  in  a [5XGAP[105X session after a [11Xgaprc[111X file has been read then no more
  [11Xgaprc[111X file will be read when [5XGAP[105X is started with this workspace.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlso  note  that  the  file  must be called [11Xgaprc[111X. If you use a Windows text
  editor,  in  particular  if  your  default is not to show file suffixes, you
  might  accidentally  create a file [11Xgaprc.txt[111X or [11Xgaprc.doc[111X which GAP will not

  [33X[0;0YSome  aspects of the behaviour of [5XGAP[105X can be customized by the user via [13Xuser
  preferences[113X. Examples include the way help sections are displayed or the use
  of colors in the terminal.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUser preferences are specified via a pair of strings, the first is the (case
  insensitive)  name  of a package (or [10X"GAP"[110X for the core [5XGAP[105X library) and the
  second is some arbitrary case sensitive string.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUser  preferences  can  be  set  to  some  [3Xvalue[103X with [2XSetUserPreference[102X. The
  current value of a user preference can be found with [2XUserPreference[102X. In both
  cases,  if  no  package  name  is given the default [10X"GAP"[110X is used. If a user
  preference is not known or not set then [2XUserPreference[102X returns [9Xfail[109X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function  [2XShowUserPreferences[102X  with  no  argument  shows  in a pager an
  overview  of  all  known user preferences together with some explanation and
  the  current value. If one or more strings [3Xpackage1[103X, ... are given then only
  the user preferences for these packages are shown.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  easiest  way  to  make  use  of user preferences is probably to use the
  function  [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X, usually without argument. This function creates a
  file [11Xgap.ini[111X in your user specific [5XGAP[105X root directory ([10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X).
  If  such  a file already exists the function will make a backup of it first.
  This  newly created file contains descriptions of all known user preferences
  and  also  calls  of  [2XSetUserPreference[102X  for  those  user  preferences which
  currently  do  not  have their default value. You can then edit that file to
  customize (further) the user preferences for future [5XGAP[105X sessions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YShould  a  later  version  of  [5XGAP[105X  or  some  packages  introduce  new  user
  preferences  then  you  can call [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X again since it will set the
  previously known user preferences to their current values.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOptionally,  a  different  directory  for  the resulting [11Xgap.ini[111X file can be
  specified  as  argument [3Xdir[103X to [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X. Another optional argument is
  the  boolean  value  [9Xtrue[109X,  if  this  is  given,  the  settings  of all user
  preferences in the current session are ignored.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  your  [11Xgap.ini[111X  file is read by [5XGAP[105X very early during its startup
  process.   A   consequence   is  that  the  [3Xvalue[103X  argument  in  a  call  of
  [2XSetUserPreference[102X  must  be some very basic [5XGAP[105X object, usually a boolean, a
  number,  a  string  or  a list of those. A few user preferences support more
  complicated  settings.  For  example,  the  user preference [10X"UseColorPrompt"[110X
  admits  a  record as its value whose components are available only after the
  [5XGAPDoc[105X  package  has  been  loaded,  see [2XColorPrompt[102X ([14X3.6-1[114X). If you want to
  specify  such  a  complicated  value,  then  move  the corresponding call of
  [2XSetUserPreference[102X  from  your [11Xgap.ini[111X file into your [11Xgaprc[111X file (also in the
  directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X). This file is read much later.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X workspace files are binary files that contain the data of a [5XGAP[105X session.
  One  can  produce  a  workspace file with [2XSaveWorkspace[102X ([14X3.3-1[114X), and load it
  into a new [5XGAP[105X session using the [10X-L[110X command line option, see Section [14X3.1[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne  purpose  of  workspace  files  is  of  course the possibility to save a
  [21Xsnapshot[121X image of the current [5XGAP[105X workspace in a file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  recommended  way  to  start  [5XGAP[105X is to load an existing workspace file,
  because  this  reduces  the  startup time of [5XGAP[105X drastically. So if you have
  installed [5XGAP[105X yourself then you should think about creating a workspace file
  immediately  after  you have started [5XGAP[105X, and then using this workspace file
  later on, whenever you start [5XGAP[105X. If your [5XGAP[105X installation is shared between
  several  users, the system administrator should think about providing such a
  workspace file.[133X

  [3Xfilename[103X.  This  image  then can be loaded by another copy of [5XGAP[105X which then
  will behave as at the point when [2XSaveWorkspace[102X was called.[133X

  [33X[0;0YSeveral global values control the [5XGAP[105X session, such as the command line, the
  architecture,  or  the information about available and loaded packages. Many
  of  these  values are accessible as components of the global record [2XGAPInfo[102X.
  Typically,  these components are set and read in low level [5XGAP[105X functions, so
  changing  the  values  of  existing  components  of  [2XGAPInfo[102X  [21Xby hand[121X is not
  recommended.[133X

  [1X3.6 [33X[0;0YColoring the Prompt and Input[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  provides  hooks for functions which are called when the prompt is to be
  printed and when an input line is finished.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn example of using this feature is the following function.[133X
  
  [1X3.6-1 ColorPrompt[101X
  
  [29X[2XColorPrompt[102X( [3Xbool[103X[, [3Xoptrec[103X] ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YWith  [10XColorPrompt(true);[110X [5XGAP[105X changes its user interface: The prompts and the
  user input are displayed in different colors. Switch off the colored prompts
  with [10XColorPrompt(false);[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  this  will only work if your terminal emulation in which you run
  [5XGAP[105X  understands  the  so  called  ANSI  color  escape sequences –almost all
  terminal  emulations  on  current  UNIX/Linux  ([10Xxterm[110X,  [10Xrxvt[110X,  [10Xkonsole[110X, ...)
  systems do so.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  colors  shown depend on the terminal configuration and cannot be forced
  from  an  application. If your terminal follows the ANSI conventions you see
  the  standard  prompt in bold blue and the break loop prompt in bold red, as
  well as your input in red.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf    it    works   for   you   and   you   like   it,   put   a   call   of
  [10XSetUserPreference("UseColorPrompt", true);[110X in your [11Xgap.ini[111X file. If you want
  a   more   complicated   setting   as   explained   below   then   put  your
  [10XSetUserPreference("UseColorPrompt", rec( ... ) );[110X call into your [11Xgaprc[111X file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  optional  second  argument  [3Xoptrec[103X  allows one to further customize the
  behaviour.  It  must  be  a  record  from which the following components are
  recognized:[133X
