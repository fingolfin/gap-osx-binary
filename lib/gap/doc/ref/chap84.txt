  [33X[0;0YIn  this chapter we describe which information the help system needs about a
  manual  book  and how to tell it this information. The code which implements
  this interface can be found in [11Xlib/helpbase.gi[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  are intending to use a documentation format that is already used by
  some  other  help  book  you  probably don't need to know anything from this
  chapter.  However,  if you want to create a new format and make it available
  to [5XGAP[105X then hopefully you will find the necessary information here.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  basic  idea of the help system is as follows: One tells [5XGAP[105X a directory
  which  contains  a  file  [11Xmanual.six[111X,  seeÂ [14X84.1[114X.  When the [5XGAP[105X help is asked
  something  about  this book it reads in some basic information from the file
  [11Xmanual.six[111X:  strings like section headers, function names, and index entries
  to  be  searched by the online help; information about the available formats
  of  this book like text, html, dvi, and pdf; the actual files containing the
  documentation,  corresponding  section numbers, and page numbers: and so on.
  SeeÂ [14X84.2[114X for a description of the format of the [11Xmanual.six[111X file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  turns  out  that  there  is  almost  no restriction on the format of the
  [11Xmanual.six[111X  file,  except  that  it must provide a string, say [10X"myownformat"[110X
  which  identifies  the  format of the help book. Then the basic actions on a
  help  book are delegated by the help system to handler functions stored in a
  record   [10XHELP_BOOK_HANDLER.myownformat[110X.   SeeÂ [14X84.3[114X   for  information  which
  functions  must be provided by the handler and what they are supposed to do.
  The  main  work  to teach [5XGAP[105X to use a new document format is to write these
  handler functions and to produce an appropriate [11Xmanual.six[111X file.[133X

  [29X[2XHELP_ADD_BOOK[102X( [3Xshort[103X, [3Xlong[103X, [3Xdir[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  command  tells  [5XGAP[105X  that  in  directory [3Xdir[103X (given as either a string
  describing  the path relative to the [5XGAP[105X root directory [10XGAPInfo.RootPaths[1][110X
  or  as  directory  object) contains the basic information about a help book.
  The  string [3Xshort[103X is used as an identifying name for that book by the online
  help.  The  string  [3Xlong[103X should be a short explanation of the content of the
  book.  Both  strings  together  should  easily fit on a line, since they are
  displayed with [10X?books[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is possible to reinstall a book with different strings [3Xshort[103X, [3Xlong[103X; (for
  example,  documentation  of  a  not-loaded [5XGAP[105X package indicates this in the
  string  [3Xshort[103X  and  if  you  later load the package, [5XGAP[105X quietly changes the
  string [3Xshort[103X as it reinstalls its documentation).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  only  condition  necessary  to make the installation of a book [13Xvalid[113X is
  that  the  directory  [3Xdir[103X  must  contain a file [11Xmanual.six[111X. The next section
  explains how this file must look.[133X

  any more. The book can be re-installed using [2XHELP_ADD_BOOK[102X ([14X84.1-1[114X).[133X

  [33X[0;0Ywhere  [3Xmyownformat[103X  is an identifying string for this format. The reading of
  the   (remainder   of   the)   file   is  then  delegated  to  the  function
  [10XHELP_BOOK_HANDLER.[3Xmyownformat[103X[10X.ReadSix[110X  which  must  exist. Thus there are no
  further  regulations  for the format of the [11Xmanual.six[111X file, other that what
  you  yourself  impose. If such a line is missing then it is assumed that the
  [11Xmanual.six[111X file complies with the [11Xgapmacro.tex[111X documentation format which is
  the [10Xdefault[110X format.[133X

  functionality.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  implementation example of such a set of handler functions is the [10Xdefault[110X

  format, and this is contained in the file [11Xlib/helpdef.gi[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  [5XGAPDoc[105X  (see  ChapterÂ [14X'GAPDoc: Introduction and Example'[114X) also
  defines  a  format  (as  it  should) which is called: [10XGapDocGAP[110X (the case [13Xis[113X
  significant).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs you can see by the above two examples, the name for a document format can
  be anything, but it should be in some way meaningful.[133X

  [10XReadSix( [3Xstream[103X[10X )[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6YFor an input text stream [3Xstream[103X to a [11Xmanual.six[111X file, this must return
        a  record  [3Xinfo[103X  which  has  at  least  the  following two components:
        [10Xbookname[110X  which  is  the  short identifying name of the help book, and
        [10Xentries[110X.  Here  [3Xinfo[103X[10X.entries[110X  must be a list with one entry per search
        string  (which can be a section header, function name, index entry, or
        whatever  seems  sensible to be searched for matching a help query). A
        [13Xmatch[113X  for the [5XGAP[105X help is a pair ([3Xinfo[103X, [3Xi[103X) where [3Xi[103X refers to an index
        for  the  list [3Xinfo[103X[10X.entries[110X and this corresponds to a certain position
        in the document. There is one further regulation for the format of the
        entries  of  [3Xinfo[103X[10X.entries[110X. They must be lists and the first element of
        such  a list must be a string which is printed by [5XGAP[105X for example when
        several matches are found for a query (so it should essentially be the
        string  which  is  searched  for the match, except that it may contain
        upper  and  lower  case  letters  or  some markup). There may be other
        components  in [3Xinfo[103X which are needed by the functions below, but their
        names and formats are not prescribed. The [3Xstream[103X argument is typically
        generated using [2XInputTextFile[102X ([14X10.5-1[114X), e.g.[133X

        those  parts  of  [3Xtopic[103X  which  are  separated  by  spaces  should  be

        [3Xtopic[103X  can  be  assumed to be already normalized (transformed to lower
