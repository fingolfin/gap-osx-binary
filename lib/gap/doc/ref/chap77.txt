  [33X[0;0YIn  general  we try to keep [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 compatible with former releases as much as
  possible.  Nevertheless,  from  time  to time it seems appropriate to remove
  some  commands  or  to change the names of some commands or variables. There
  are  various  reasons  for  that:  Some  functionality  was improved and got
  another  (hopefully better) interface, names turned out to be too special or
  too  general  for  the  underlying  functionality,  or names are found to be
  unintuitive or inconsistent with other names.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  chapter  we  collect such old names while pointing to the sections
  which  explain  how to substitute them. Usually, old names will be available
  for  several  releases;  they may be removed when they don't seem to be used
  any more.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe obsolete [5XGAP[105X code is collected in two library files, [11Xlib/obsolete.gd[111X and
  [11Xlib/obsolete.gi[111X.  By  default,  these files are read when [5XGAP[105X is started. It
  may be useful to omit reading these files, for example in order to make sure
  that  one's  own [5XGAP[105X code does not rely on the obsolete variables. For that,
  one  can  use  the  [10X-O[110X  command  line  option (see [14X3.1[114X) or set the component
  [10XReadObsolete[110X  in  the  file [11Xgap.ini[111X to [9Xfalse[109X (see [14X3.2[114X). Note that [10X-O[110X command
  line option overrides [10XReadObsolete[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(Note  that  the  condition  whether the library files with the obsolete [5XGAP[105X
  code  shall  be  read  has changed. In [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 and 4.4, the global variables
  [10XGAP_OBSOLESCENT[110X  and  [10XGAPInfo.ReadObsolete[110X  â€“to  be set in the user's [11X.gaprc[111X

  [1X77.1 [33X[0;0YGroup Actions â€“ Name Changes[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe concept of a group action is sometimes referred to as a [21Xgroup operation[121X.
  In  [5XGAP[105XÂ 3  as well as in older versions of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 the term [10XOperation[110X was used
  instead  of  [10XAction[110X.  We decided to change the names to avoid confusion with
  the term [21Xoperation[121X as in [2XDeclareOperation[102X ([14X79.18-6[114X) and [21Xoperations for Xyz[121X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWith  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4  the  package  interface  was  changed. Thereby some functions
  became obsolete and the names of some others were made more consistent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe    following   functions   are   no   longer   needed:   [10XDeclarePackage[110X,
  [10XDeclareAutoPackage[110X,              [10XDeclarePackageDocumentation[110X             and
  [10XDeclarePackageAutoDocumentation[110X.  They  are  substituted  by  entries in the
  packages' [11XPackageInfo.g[111X files, see [14X76.3-11[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,  the  global  variable  [10XPACKAGES_VERSIONS[110X  is no longer needed,
  since  this  information is now contained in the [10XGAPInfo.PackagesInfo[110X record
  (see  [14X3.5-1[114X).  The global variable [10XRevisions[110X is also no longer needed, since
  the function [10XDisplayRevision[110X was made obsolete in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.5.[133X

  [33X[0;0YFormer  versions  of  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4  documented  several functions for computing the
  Smith  or  Hermite  normal form of integer matrices. Some of them were never
  implemented  and  it was unclear which commands to use. The functionality of
  all  of these commands is now available with [2XNormalFormIntMat[102X ([14X25.2-9[114X) and a
  few interface functions.[133X
  
  
  [1X77.4 [33X[0;0YMiscellaneous Name Changes or Removed Names[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  former  releases of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 there were some global variable names bound to
  general  information  about  the  running [5XGAP[105X, such as path names or command
  line options. Although they were not officially documented they were used by
  several  users  and in some packages. We mention here [10XBANNER[110X and [10XQUIET[110X. This
  type of information is now collected in the global record [2XGAPInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X).[133X

  [1X77.4-1 InfoObsolete[101X
  
  [29X[2XInfoObsolete[102X[32X global variable
  
  [33X[0;0Yis  an  info class to display warnings when an obsolete variable is used. By
  default, these warnings are switched off since the info level for this class
  is  0.  Setting  it  to  1  will trigger warnings if [5XGAP[105X will detect that an
  obsolete  variable  is used at runtime (this detection is possible, however,
  only for obsolete variables declared using [10XDeclareObsoleteSynonym[110X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  check  that  the [5XGAP[105X code does not use obsolete variables at the parsing
  time, and not at a runtime, use [10X-O[110X command line option, see [14X3.1[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X77.5 [33X[0;0YThe former .gaprc file[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YUp to [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4, a file [11X.gaprc[111X in the user's home directory (if available, and
  [5XGAP[105X  was  started  without [10X-r[110X option) was read automatically during startup,
  early enough for influencing the autoloading of packages and late enough for
  being  allowed  to  execute  any [5XGAP[105X code. On Windows machines this file was
  called [11Xgap.rc[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.5 the startup mechanism has changed, see [14X3.2[114X for details. These new
  configuration files are now contained in a directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the  sake  of  partial  backwards  compatibility,  also the former file
  [11X~/.gaprc[111X  is still supported for such initializations, but this file is read
  only  if  the directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X does not exist. In that case the
  [11X~/.gaprc[111X  is  read  at the same time as [11Xgaprc[111X would be read, i.Â e., too late
  for influencing the startup of [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs before, the command line option [10X-r[110X disables reading [11X~/.gaprc[111X, see [14X3.1[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  migrate from the old setup to the new one introduced with [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.5, first
  have  a  look  at the function [2XWriteGapIniFile[102X ([14X3.2-3[114X). Many users will find
  that  all  or  most of what was set in the old [11X~/.gaprc[111X file can now be done
  via  the  user  preferences  in  a  [11Xgap.ini[111X  file.  If  you had code for new
  functions  or  abbreviations  in  your old [11X~/.gaprc[111X file or you were reading
  additional  files,  then  move this into the file [11Xgaprc[111X (without the leading
  dot,   same   name   for   all   operating   systems)   in   the   directory
  [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X.[133X
