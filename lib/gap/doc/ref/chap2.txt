  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  describes  the [5XGAP[105X help system. The help system lets you read
  the documentation interactively.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YInvoking the Help[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  basic  command to read [5XGAP[105X's documentation from within a [5XGAP[105X session is
  as follows.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?[[3Xbook[103X[10X:][?][3Xtopic[103X[10X[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor an explanation and some examples seeÂ [14X'Tutorial: Help'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  first question mark must appear in the [13Xfirst position[113X after
  the  [10Xgap>  [110X  prompt.  The  search strings [3Xbook[103X and [3Xtopic[103X are normalized in a
  certain  way  (see  the  end  of this section for details) before the search
  starts.  This  makes  the search case insensitive and there can be arbitrary
  white space after the first question mark.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  there are several manual sections that match the query a numbered list
  of topics is displayed. These matches can be accessed with [10X?[3Xnumber[103X[10X[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  some  further  specially  handled  commands  which  start with a
  question mark. They are explained in SectionÂ [14X2.2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  default  [5XGAP[105X  shows  the help sections as text in the terminal (window),
  page  by  page  if  the shown text does not fit on the screen. But there are
  several other choices to read (other formats of) the documents: via a viewer
  for [10Xpdf[110X files or via a web browser. This is explained below in SectionÂ [14X2.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XDetails of the string normalization process[113X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  is  a  precise  description  how the search strings [3Xbook[103X and [3Xtopic[103X are
  normalized  before  a search starts: backslashes and double or single quotes
  are  removed,  parentheses  and  braces are substituted by blanks, non-ASCII
  characters  are considered as ISO-latin1 characters and the accented letters
  are  substituted  by  their non-accented counterpart. Finally white space is
  normalized.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YBrowsing through the Sections[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YHelp  books  for  [5XGAP[105X  are organized in chapters, sections, and subsections.
  There are a few special commands starting with a question mark (in the first
  position  after  the  [10Xgap>  [110X  prompt) which allow browsing a book section or
  chapter wise.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?>[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?<[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  two  help  commands  [10X?<[110X and [10X?>[110X allow one to browse through a whole help
  book.  [10X?<[110X  displays the section or subsection preceding the previously shown
  (sub)section,  and  [10X?>[110X  takes you to the section or subsection following the
  previously shown one.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?>>[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?<<[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?<<[110X  takes  you  back  to  the  beginning of the current chapter. If you are
  already  at  the  start  of  a chapter [10X?<<[110X takes you to the beginning of the
  previous chapter. [10X?>>[110X takes you to the beginning of the next chapter.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?-[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?+[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  remembers the last few sections that you have read. [10X?-[110X takes you to the
  one  that  you  have  read  before  the  current one, and displays it again.
  Further  applications  of  [10X?-[110X  take  you  further  back  in this history. [10X?+[110X
  reverses  this process, i.e., it takes you back to the section that you have
  read  after  the  current one. It is important to note that [10X?-[110X and [10X?+[110X do not
  alter the history like the other help commands.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10X?books[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis command shows a list of the books which are currently known to the help
  system. For each book there is a short name which is used with the [3Xbook[103X part
  of  the  basic help query and there is a long name which hopefully tells you
  what this book is about.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  short  name  which  ends  in  [10X(not  loaded)[110X refers to a [5XGAP[105X package whose
  documentation  is  loaded  but  which  needs  a call of [2XLoadPackage[102X ([14X76.2-1[114X)
  before you can use the described functions.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThese  commands  show tables of contents for all available, respectively the
  matching  books.  For  some  books  these commands show the same, namely the
  whole table of contents.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[10X?&[110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese  commands  redisplay  the  last shown help section. In the form [10X?&[110X the
  next  preferred help viewer is used for the display (provided one has chosen
  several viewers), seeÂ [2XSetHelpViewer[102X ([14X2.3-1[114X) below.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.3 [33X[0;0YChanging the Help Viewer[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YBooks  of the [5XGAP[105X help system or package manuals can be available in several
  formats.  Currently  the  following  formats  occur  (not all of them may be
  available for all books):[133X
  
  [8Xtext[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is  used  for  display  in  the  terminal window in which [5XGAP[105X is
        running.  Complicated mathematical expressions may not be easy to read
        in this format.[133X
  
  [8Xpdf[108X
        [33X[0;6YAdobe's  [10Xpdf[110X  format. Can be used for printing and onscreen reading on
        most  current  systems  (with  freely available software). Some manual
        books contain hyperlinks in this format.[133X
  
  [8XHTML[108X
        [33X[0;6YThe  format  of web pages. Can be used with any web browser. There may
        be  hyperlink information available which allows a convenient browsing
        through  the  book  via  cross-references. This format has the problem
        that complicated formulae may be not be easy to read since there is no
        syntax  for  formulae  in  HTML.  (Some older manual books use special
        symbol  fonts  for formulae and need a particular configuration of the
        web  browser  for correct display. Some manuals may use technology for
        quite sophisticated formula display.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDepending on your operating system and available additional software you can
  use several of these formats with [5XGAP[105X's help system. This is configured with
  the following command.[133X
  
  [1X2.3-1 SetHelpViewer[101X
  
  [29X[2XSetHelpViewer[102X( [3Xviewer1[103X, [3Xviewer2[103X, [3X...[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  command  takes  an arbitrary number of arguments which must be strings
  describing a viewer. The recognized viewers are explained below. A call with
  no arguments shows the current setting.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first  given  arguments  are  those with higher priority. So, if a help
  section  is  available in the format needed by [3Xviewer1[103X, this viewer is used.
  If  not, availability of the format for [3Xviewer2[103X is checked and so on. Recall
  that  the  command [10X?&[110X displays the last seen section again but with the next
  possible viewer in your list, seeÂ [14X2.2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  viewer [10X"screen"[110X (see below) is always silently appended since we assume
  that each help book is available in text format.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  want  to  change  the  default  setting  you  can  use  a  call  of
  [10XSetUserPreference(  "HelpViewers",  [  ...  ]  );[110X  (the  list  in the second
  argument containing the viewers you want) in your [11Xgap.ini[111X file (seeÂ [14X3.2[114X).[133X
  
  [8X[10X"screen"[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is  the  default setting. The help is shown in text format using
        the  [2XPager[102X  ([14X2.4-1[114X)  command.  Hint:  Text  versions  of  manuals  are
        formatted  assuming that your terminal displays at least 80 characters
        per  line, if this is not the case some sections may look very bad. We
        suggest  to  use  a terminal in [10XUTF-8[110X encoding with a fixed width font
        (this is the default on most modern Linux/Windows/Mac systems anyway).
        Terminals  in  [10XISO-8859-X[110X  encoding will also work reasonably well (so
        far,  since  we  do  not  yet  use  many special characters which such
        terminals could not display).[133X

        [33X[0;6YIf  a  book  is  available  in  HTML  format  this  is shown using the
        corresponding web browser. How well this works, for example by using a
        running  instance  of  this  browser, depends on your particular start
        script  of  this  browser.  (Note, that for some old books the browser
        must be configured to use symbol fonts.)[133X

        respectively, inside the terminal running [5XGAP[105X. (Formulae in some older

        a   web   browser.   The   options  [10X"safari"[110X  and  [10X"firefox"[110X  use  the
        corresponding  browsers. The other two options use the program default
        browser  (which  can  be set in Safari's preferences, in the "General"
        tab).[133X

        [33X[0;6Y(on  X-windows  systems)  If  a  book is available in pdf format it is
        shown  with  the onscreen viewer program [10Xxpdf[110X (which must be installed
        on  your  system).  This  is  a nice program, once it is running it is
        reused by [5XGAP[105X for the next displays of help sections.[133X
  
  [8X[10X"acroread"[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  a  book  is  available in pdf format it is shown with the onscreen
        viewer program [10Xacroread[110X (which must be available on your system). This
        program  does  not allow remote commands or startup with a given page.
        Therefore  the  page numbers you have to visit are just printed on the
        screen.  When  you  are  looking at several sections of the same book,
        this viewer assumes that the [10Xacroread[110X window still exists. When you go
        to another book a new acroread window is launched.[133X
  
  [8X[10X"pdf viewer"[110X, [10X"skim"[110X, [10X"preview"[110X, [10X"adobe reader"[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6Y(for Mac OS X) If a book is available in pdf format this is shown in a
        pdf  viewer.  The options [10X"skim"[110X, [10X"preview"[110X and [10X"adobe reader"[110X use the
        corresponding  viewers. The other two options use the pdf viewer which
        you  have  chosen  to  open  pdf files from the Finder. Note that only
        [10X"Skim"[110X seems to be capable to open a pdf file on a given page. For the
        other  help  viewers,  the  page  numbers where the information can be
        found  will  just  be  printed on the screen. None of the help viewers
        seems  to be capable of opening a pdf at a given named destination (i.
        e.,  jump  to precisely the place where the information can be found).
        The  pdf  viewer  [10X"Skim"[110X is open source software, it can be downloaded

  [1X2.4 [33X[0;0YThe Pager Command[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X contains a builtin pager which shows a text string which does not fit on
  the  screen  page  by  page.  Its  functionality  is  very  rudimentary  and
  self-explaining.  This  is  because (at least under UNIX) there are powerful
  external standard programs which do this job.[133X
  
  [1X2.4-1 Pager[101X
  
  [29X[2XPager[102X( [3Xlines[103X ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  function  can be used to display a text on screen using a pager, i.e.,
  the text is shown page by page.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  is a default builtin pager in [5XGAP[105X which has very limited capabilities
  but should work on any system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAt least on a UNIX system one should use an external pager program like [10Xless[110X
  or  [10Xmore[110X.  [5XGAP[105X assumes that this program has a command line option [10X+nr[110X which
  starts the display of the text with line number [10Xnr[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhich  pager  is  used  can  be  controlled  by  setting the user preference
  [10X"Pager"[110X.  The default value is [10X"builtin"[110X which means that the internal pager
  is used.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOn  UNIX systems you probably want to set the user preference [10X"Pager"[110X to the
  value  [10X"less"[110X  or  [10X"more"[110X,  you can do this for example in your [11Xgap.ini[111X file
  (see [14X3.2[114X). In that case you can also tell [5XGAP[105X a list of standard options for
  the external pager, via the user preference [10X"PagerOptions"[110X.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[28X  SetUserPreference( "Pager", "less" );[128X[104X
    [4X[28X  SetUserPreference( "PagerOptions", ["-f","-r","-a","-i","-M","-j2"] );[128X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe argument [3Xlines[103X can have one of the following forms:[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6Ya string (i.e., lines are separated by newline characters)[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6Ya  list  of strings (without newline characters) which are interpreted
        as lines of the text to be shown[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6Ya  record  with  component  [10Xlines[110X  as in 1. or 2. and optional further
        components[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn caseÂ 3. currently the following additional components are used:[133X
  
  [8X[10Xformatted[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan  be  [9Xfalse[109X or [9Xtrue[109X. If set to [9Xtrue[109X the builtin pager tries to show
        the  text  exactly  as  it  is  given  (avoiding  [5XGAP[105X's automatic line
        breaking),[133X
  
  [8X[10Xstart[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6Ymust  be  a positive integer. This is interpreted as the number of the
        first  line  shown by the pager (one may see the beginning of the text
        via back scrolling).[133X
  
  [8X[10XexitAtEnd[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan  be [9Xfalse[109X or [9Xtrue[109X. If set to [9Xtrue[109X (the default), the builtin pager
        is  terminated  as  soon  as  the  end of the list is shown; otherwise
        entering the [12Xq[112X key is necessary in order to return from the pager.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [2XPager[102X command is used by [5XGAP[105X's help system for displaying help sections
  in text format. But, of course, it may be used for other purposes as well.[133X
