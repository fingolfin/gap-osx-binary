  [33X[0;0YPeople   and  computers  spend  a  large  amount  of  time  with  searching.
  Dictionaries  are an abstract data structure which facilitates searching for
  objects.  Depending  on  the  kind  of objects the implementation will use a
  variety  of  possible  internal storage methods that will aim to provide the
  fastest possible access to objects. These internal methods include[133X

  [1X28.1 [33X[0;0YUsing Dictionaries[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  standard way to use dictionaries is to first create a dictionary (using
  [2XNewDictionary[102X   ([14X28.2-1[114X),   and   then  to  store  objects  (and  associated
  information) in it and look them up.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the  creation  of  objects  the  user has to make a few choices: Is the
  dictionary  only  to  be used to check whether objects are known already, or
  whether associated information is to be stored with the objects. This second
  case  is  called a [13Xlookup dictionary[113X and is selected by the second parameter
  of [2XNewDictionary[102X ([14X28.2-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  second  choice  is  to indicate which kind of objects are to be stored.
  This  choice  will decide the internal storage used. This kind of objects is
  specified  by  the  first  parameter  to  [2XNewDictionary[102X ([14X28.2-1[114X), which is a
  [21Xsample[121X object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  some  cases  however  such  a  sample object is not specific enough. For
  example  when  storing  vectors  over  a finite field, it would not be clear
  whether  all  vectors  will be over a prime field or over a field extension.
  Such an issue can be resolved by indicating in an (optional) third parameter
  to  [2XNewDictionary[102X  ([14X28.2-1[114X)  a [13Xdomain[113X which has to be a collection that will
  contain all objects to be used with this dictionary. (Such a domain may also
  be used internally to decide that direct indexing can be used).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe reason for this choice of giving two parameters is that in some cases no
  suitable  collection  of  objects  has been defined in [5XGAP[105X - for example for
  permutations  there  is  no  object  representing  the  symmetric  group  on
  infinitely many points.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOnce   a   dictionary   has   been   created,   it   is   possible   to  use
  [2XRepresentationsOfObject[102X  ([14X13.4-1[114X)  to  check which representation is used by
  [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the following example, we create a dictionary to store permutations with
  associated information.[133X

  [33X[0;0YA typical example of this use would be in an orbit algorithm. The dictionary
  would  be  used to store the elements known in the orbit together with their
  respective orbit positions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  observe  that  this dictionary is stored internally by a sorted list. On
  the other hand, if we have an explicit, sorted element list, direct indexing
  is to be used.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  same  effect  happens  in  the following example, in which we work with
  vectors: Indicating only a vector only enables sorted index, as it cannot be

  [1X28.2 [33X[0;0YDictionaries[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis   section  contains  the  formal  declarations  for  dictionaries.  For
  information  on  how to use them, please refer to the previous section [14X28.1[114X.
  There are several ways how dictionaries are implemented: As lists, as sorted
  lists,  as hash tables or via binary lists. A user however will just have to
  call [2XNewDictionary[102X ([14X28.2-1[114X) and obtain a [21Xsuitable[121X dictionary for the kind of
  objects  she  wants  to create. It is possible however to create hash tables
  (see [14X28.4[114X)  and  dictionaries  using  binary lists (see [2XDictionaryByPosition[102X
  ([14X28.3-1[114X)).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  use  of  two  objects,  [3Xobj[103X  and  [3Xobjcoll[103X  to parametrize the objects a
  dictionary  is  able  to  store  might  look  confusing.  However  there are
  situations where either of them might be needed:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first  situation  is  that  of  objects, for which no formal [21Xcollection
  object[121X  has  been  defined.  A  typical example here might be subspaces of a
  vector  space.  [5XGAP[105X does not formally define a [21XGrassmannian[121X or anything else
  to  represent the multitude of all subspaces. So it is only possible to give
  the dictionary a [21Xsample object[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  other situation is that of an object which might represent quite varied
  domains.  The  permutation  [22X(1,10^6)[122X  might  be  the nontrivial element of a
  cyclic  group  of  order 2, it might be a representative of [22XS_{10^6}[122X. In the
  first  situation the best approach might be just to have two entries for the
  two possible objects, in the second situation a much more elaborate approach
  might be needed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn algorithm that creates a dictionary will usually know a priori, from what
  domain  all  the  objects  will be, giving this domain permits to use a more
  efficient dictionary.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  is  particularly  true  for  vectors.  From a single vector one cannot
  decide  whether  a  calculation  will  take  place  over  the smallest field
  containing all its entries or over a larger field.[133X

  [29X[2XNewDictionary[102X( [3Xobj[103X, [3Xlook[103X[, [3Xobjcoll[103X] ) [32X function
  
  [33X[0;0Ycreates  a  new  dictionary for objects such as [3Xobj[103X. If [3Xobjcoll[103X is given the
  dictionary  will  be for objects only from this collection, knowing this can
  improve  the performance. If [3Xobjcoll[103X is given, [3Xobj[103X may be replaced by [9Xfalse[109X,
  i.e. no sample object is needed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function  tries  to  find  the  right  kind of dictionary for the basic
  dictionary  functions to be quick. If [3Xlook[103X is [9Xtrue[109X, the dictionary will be a

  bit list corresponding to [3Xlist[103X indicating the known values. If [3Xlook[103X is [9Xtrue[109X,

  [33X[0;0YThese  sections  describe  some  particularities  for hash tables. These are
  intended  mainly  for extending the implementation - programs requiring hash
  functionality ought to use the dictionary interface described above.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  hash  by  keys  and  also store a value. Keys cannot be removed from the
  table,  but the corresponding value can be changed. Fast access to last hash
  index  allows  you  to efficiently store more than one array of values –this
  facility should be used with care.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  code  works  for  any  kind of object, provided you have a [2XDenseIntKey[102X
  ([14X28.5-1[114X)  method  to  convert  the  key into a positive integer. This method
  should ideally be implemented efficiently in the core.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote that, for efficiency, it is currently impossible to create a hash table
  with non-positive integers.[133X
  
  
  [1X28.5 [33X[0;0YHash keys[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  crucial  step of hashing is to transform key objects into integers such
  that equal objects produce the same integer.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe actual function used will vary very much on the type of objects. However
  [5XGAP[105X provides already key functions for some commonly encountered objects.[133X
  
  [1X28.5-1 DenseIntKey[101X

  [33X[0;0Yreturns a function that can be used as hash key function for objects such as
  [3Xobj[103X in the collection [3Xobjcoll[103X. Typically, [3Xobjcoll[103X will be a large domain. If
  the domain is not available, it can be given as [9Xfalse[109X in which case the hash
  key function will be determined only based on [3Xobj[103X. (For a further discussion
  of these two arguments see [2XNewDictionary[102X ([14X28.2-1[114X)).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function returned by [2XDenseIntKey[102X is guaranteed to give different values
