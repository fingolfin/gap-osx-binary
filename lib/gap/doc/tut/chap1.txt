  [33X[0;0YWelcome  to  [5XGAP[105X. This preface serves not only to introduce this manual, [21Xthe
  [5XGAP[105X Tutorial[121X, but also as an introduction to the system as a whole.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  stands  for  [13XGroups, Algorithms and Programming[113X. The name was chosen to
  reflect  the aim of the system, which is introduced in this tutorial manual.
  Since that choice, the system has become somewhat broader, and you will also
  find  information  about  algorithms  and  programming  for  other algebraic
  structures, such as semigroups and algebras.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  addition  to  this  manual, there is the [13X[5XGAP[105X Reference Manual[113X containing
  detailed  documentation  of  the  mathematical functionality of [5XGAP[105X, and the
  manual  called  [13X[21X[5XGAP[105X  -  Changes  from  Earlier Versions[121X[113X which describes most
  essential changes from previous [5XGAP[105X releases.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  lot  of  the  functionality  of  the  system  and a number of contributed
  extensions  are  provided  as  [21X[5XGAP[105X  packages[121X  and  each of these has its own
  manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSubsequent  sections of this preface explain the structure of the system and
  list sources of further information about [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe [5XGAP[105X[101X[1X System[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  is  a  [13Xfree[113X,  [13Xopen[113X  and  [13Xextensible[113X software package for computation in
  discrete  abstract  algebra. The terms [21Xfree[121X and [21Xopen[121X describe the conditions
  under  which  the  system  is  distributed -- in brief, it is [13Xfree of charge[113X
  (except  possibly  for the immediate costs of delivering it to you), you are
  [13Xfree  to  pass  it  on[113X within certain limits, and all of the workings of the
  system  are  [13Xopen for you to examine and change[113X. Details of these conditions
  can be found in Section [14X'Reference: Copyright and License'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  system is [21Xextensible[121X in that you can write your own programs in the [5XGAP[105X
  language,  and use them in just the same way as the programs which form part
  of  the  system (the [21Xlibrary[121X). Indeed, we actively support the contribution,
  refereeing  and distribution of extensions to the system, in the form of [21X[5XGAP[105X
  packages[121X.  Further details of this can be found in chapter [14X'Reference: Using
  GAP Packages'[114X, and on our website.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YDevelopment  of  [5XGAP[105X began at Lehrstuhl D fÃ¼r Mathematik, RWTH-Aachen, under
  the leadership of Joachim NeubÃ¼ser in 1985. Version 2.4 was released in 1988
  and  version  3.1 in 1992. In 1997 coordination of [5XGAP[105X development, now very
  much  an  international  effort,  was  transferred to St Andrews. A complete
  internal  redesign  and  almost complete rewrite of the system was completed
  over  the  following years and version 4.1 was released in July 1999. A sign
  of  the  further internationalization of the project was the [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4 release
  in  2004,  which  has  been coordinated from Colorado State University, Fort
  Collins.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMore  information  on  the motivation and development of [5XGAP[105X to date, can be
  found on our Web pages in a section entitled [21XRelease history and Prefaces[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  those  readers  who have used an earlier version of [5XGAP[105X, an overview of
  the  changes  from  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4  and  a  brief  summary  of changes from earlier
  versions is given in a separate manual [14X'Changes: Changes between GAP 4.4 and
  GAP 4.5'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  system  that you are getting now consists of a [21Xcore system[121X and a number
  of packages. The core system consists of four main parts.[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6YA [13Xkernel[113X, written in C, which provides the user with[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Yautomatic  dynamic  storage  management,  which the user needn't
              bother about in his programming;[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ya   set  of  time-critical  basic  functions,  e.g.  [21Xarithmetic[121X,
              operations  for integers, finite fields, permutations and words,
              as well as natural operations for lists and records;[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Yan  interpreter  for  the  [5XGAP[105X  language,  an untyped imperative
              programming  language  with functions as first class objects and
              some  extra  built-in data types such as permutations and finite
              field  elements. The language supports a form of object-oriented
              programming, similar to that supported by languages like C++ and
              Java but with some important differences.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ya  small  set of system functions allowing the [5XGAP[105X programmer to
              handle  files  and  execute  external programs in a uniform way,
              regardless of the particular operating system in use.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ya  set  of  programming tools for testing, debugging, and timing
              algorithms.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12Ya [21Xread-eval-view[121X style user interface.[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6YA  much  larger  [13Xlibrary of [5XGAP[105X functions[113X that implement algebraic and
        other  algorithms. Since this is written entirely in the [5XGAP[105X language,
        the [5XGAP[105X language is both the main implementation language and the user
        language  of  the  system.  Therefore  the  user  can as easily as the
        original  programmers  investigate  and vary algorithms of the library
        and  add  new  ones  to  it,  first for own use and eventually for the
        benefit of all [5XGAP[105X users.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6YA  [13Xlibrary  of group theoretical data[113X which contains various libraries
        of  groups,  including  the  library  of  small groups (containing all
        groups  of order at most 2000, except those of order 1024) and others.
        Large  libraries of ordinary and Brauer character tables and Tables of
        Marks are included as packages.[133X
  
  [31X4[131X   [33X[0;6YThe  [13Xdocumentation[113X.  This  is  available as on-line help, as printable
        files in PDF format and as HTML for viewing with a Web browser.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlso  included  with  the  core  system  are some test files and a few small
  utilities which we hope you will find useful.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  [13Xpackages[113X  are  self-contained  extensions to the core system. A package
  contains  [5XGAP[105X code and its own documentation and may also contain data files
  or  external  programs  to  which  the [5XGAP[105X code provides an interface. These
  packages   may   be  loaded  into  [5XGAP[105X  using  the  [2XLoadPackage[102X  ([14XReference:
  LoadPackage[114X)  command,  and  both the package and its documentation are then
  available  just  as if they were parts of the core system. Some packages may
  be  loaded  automatically,  when  [5XGAP[105X  is started, if they are present. Some
  packages, because they depend on external programs, may only be available on
  the operating systems where those programs are available (usually UNIX). You
  should note that, while the packages included with this release are the most
  recent  versions  ready  for  release  at  this  time,  new packages and new
  versions  may  be  released  at any time and can be easily installed in your
  copy of [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWith  [5XGAP[105X  there  are  two  packages  (the  library  of  ordinary and Brauer
  character  tables,  and  the  library  of  tables  of  marks)  which contain
  functionality  developed  from parts of the [5XGAP[105X core system. These have been
  moved  into packages for ease of maintenance and to allow new versions to be
  released  independently  of  new releases of the core system. The library of
  small  groups  should  also  be  regarded as a package, although it does not
  currently  use  the  standard  package  mechanism.  Other  packages  contain
  functionality  which  has never been part of the core system, and may extend
  it   substantially,   implementing   specific   algorithms  to  enhance  its
  capabilities, providing data libraries, interfaces to other computer algebra
  systems  and  data  sources  such  as the electronic version of the Atlas of
  Finite  Group Representations; therefore, installation and usage of packages
  is recommended.[133X
