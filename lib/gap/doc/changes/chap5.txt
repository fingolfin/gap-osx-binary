  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  library  code for stabilizer chains contained quite some explicit
        references  to  the identity [10X()[110X. This is unfortunate if one works with
        permutation  groups,  the elements of which are not plain permutations
        but objects which carry additional information like a memory, how they
        were  obtained  from  the  group generators. For such cases it is much
        cleaner  to  use  the  [10XOne(...)[110X operation instead of [10X()[110X, such that the
        library code can be used for a richer class of group objects. This fix
        contains  only  rather  trivial  changes  [10X()[110X  to  [10XOne(...)[110X  which were
        carefully  checked  by  me.  The  tests for permutation groups all run
        without a problem. However, it is relatively difficult to provide test
        code for this particular change, since the "improvement" only shows up
        when  one generates new group objects. This is for example done in the
