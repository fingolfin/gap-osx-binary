  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  lists most important changes between [5XGAP[105X 4.4.12 and the first
  public  release  of  [5XGAP[105X  4.5. It also contains information about subsequent
  update  releases for [5XGAP[105X 4.5. It is not meant to serve as a complete account
  on  all improvements; instead, it should be viewed as an introduction to [5XGAP[105X

  [33X[0;0YPerformance improvements:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  [5XGAP[105X  kernel  now  uses  [5XGMP[105X  (GNU  multiple  precision arithmetic
        library, [7Xhttp://gmplib.org/[107X) for faster large integer arithmetic.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YImproved performance for records with large number of components.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSpeedup of hash tables implementation at the [5XGAP[105X library level.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[2XMemoryUsage[102X  ([14XReference:  MemoryUsage[114X)  is now much more efficient, in
        particular for large objects.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSpeedups   in   the   computation   of  low  index  subgroups,  Tietze
        transformations,  calculating  high  powers  of  matrices  over finite
        fields, [2XFactorial[102X ([14XReference: Factorial[114X), etc.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNew and improved kernel functionality:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YBy  default,  the  [5XGAP[105X  kernel  compiles  with  the  [5XGMP[105X  and [5Xreadline[105X
        libraries.  The [5XGMP[105X library is supplied with [5XGAP[105X and we recommend that
        you use the version we supply. There are some problems with some other
        versions.  It  is  also  possible  to  compile the [5XGAP[105X kernel with the
        system  [5XGMP[105X  if  your  system  has  it.  The  [5Xreadline[105X library must be
        installed on your system in advance to be used with [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFloating  point  literals  are  now  supported in the [5XGAP[105X language, so
        that,  floating  point  numbers can be entered in [5XGAP[105X expressions in a
        natural  way.  Support  for  floats  is  now  properly documented, see
        [14X'Reference: Floats'[114X. [5XGAP[105X has an interface using which packages may add
        new floating point implementations and integrate them with the parser.
        In  particular,  we  expect  that  there  will  soon be a package that
        implements arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe Mersenne twister random number generator has been made independent
        of  endianness,  so  that  random seeds can now be transferred between
        architectures. See [14X'Reference: GlobalMersenneTwister'[114X for details.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDefaults  for [10X-m[110X and [10X-o[110X options have been increased. Changes have been
        made  to the way that [5XGAP[105X obtains memory from the Operating System, to
        make  [5XGAP[105X  more  compatible with C libraries. A new [10X-s[110X option has been
        introduced  to  control or turn off the new behaviour, see [14X'Reference:
        Command Line Options'[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  filename  and  lines  from  which  a function was read can now be
        recovered  using [2XFilenameFunc[102X ([14XReference: FilenameFunc[114X), [2XStartlineFunc[102X
        ([14XReference:  StartlineFunc[114X)  and [2XEndlineFunc[102X ([14XReference: EndlineFunc[114X).
        This  allows  you,  for  example,  to  implement  a  function  such as
        [2XPageSource[102X  ([14XReference:  PageSource[114X)  to  show the file containing the
        source  code  of  a  function  or  a  method  in  a  pager,  see [2XPager[102X
        ([14XReference: Pager[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[2XCallFuncList[102X  ([14XReference:  CallFuncList[114X) was made into an operation so
        that  it can be used to define behaviour of a non-function when called
        as a function.[133X

  not  provide  separate  versions  of  manuals for Internet Explorer, and the
  former  [11Xtools[111X archive is now included as an archive in the [11Xetc[111X directory. To
  unpack and install the archive, user the script [11Xetc/install-tools.sh[111X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  no  longer  distribute separate bugfix archives when the core [5XGAP[105X system
  changes,  or  updated  packages  archives  when  a  redistributed package is
  updated.  Instead,  the  single  [5XGAP[105X  source  distribution  archive  will be
  labelled by the version of the core [5XGAP[105X system and also by a timestamp. This
  archive  contains  the  core  system and the stable versions of the relevant
  packages  on  that  date. To upgrade, you simply replace the whole directory
  containing the [5XGAP[105X installation, and rebuild binaries for the [5XGAP[105X kernel and
  packages.   For   new  versions  of  packages,  we  will  also  continue  to
  redistribute  individual package archives so it will be possible to update a
  single package without changing the rest of the [5XGAP[105X installation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,  by default [5XGAP[105X will now automatically read a user-specific [5XGAP[105X
  root  directory (unless [5XGAP[105X is called with the [10X-r[110X option). All user settings
  can  be  made in that directory, so there will be no risk of them being lost
  during  an  update  (see  Section  [14X4.1-3[114X  below  for  more details). Private
  packages can also be installed in this directory for the same reason.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  some  changes  in  archive formats used for the distribution: we
  continue  to  provide [11X.tar.gz[111X, [11X.tar.bz2[111X and [11X-win.zip[111X archives. We have added
  [11X.zip[111X, and stopped providing [11X.zoo[111X archives. We no longer provide GAP binaries
  for  Mac  OS 9 (Classic) any more. For installations from source on Mac OS X
  one may follow the instructions for UNIX.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWith  the release of [5XGAP[105X 4.5, we also encourage more users to take advantage
  of  the  increasingly  mature  binary distributions which are now available.
  These include:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe binary [11Xrsync[111X distribution for [5XGAP[105X on Linux PCs with i686 or x86_64

  [33X[0;0YIn the near future, we also hope to have a binary distribution for Mac OS X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YInternally,  we  now have infrastructure to support more robust and frequent
  releases,  and  an  improved  system  to  fetch and test new versions of the
  increasingly  large  number  of  packages.  The  [5XExample[105X  package  documents
  technical requirements for packages, many of which are checked automatically
  by  our  systems.  This will allow us to check the compatibility of packages
  with  the  system  and with other packages more thoroughly before publishing
  them on the [5XGAP[105X website.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.1-3 [33X[0;0YImprovements to the user interface[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  default,  [5XGAP[105X now uses the [5Xreadline[105X library for command line editing. It
  provides  such  advantages as working with unicode terminals, nicer handling
  of long input lines, improved TAB-completion and flexible configuration. For
  further details, see [14X'Reference: Editing using the readline library'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe have extended facilities for user interface customisation. By default [5XGAP[105X
  automatically scans a user specific [5XGAP[105X root directory (unless [5XGAP[105X is called
  with the [10X-r[110X option). The name of this user specific directory depends on the
  operating system and is contained in [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X. This directory can
  be  used  to  tell  [5XGAP[105X  about personal preferences, to load some additional
  code,  to  install  additional packages, or to overwrite some [5XGAP[105X files, see
  [14X'Reference:  GAP  Root  Directories'[114X. Instead of a single [11X.gaprc[111X file we now
  use  more  flexible setup based on two files: [11Xgap.ini[111X which is read early in
  the  startup process, and [11Xgaprc[111X which is read after the startup process, but
  before  the  first  input file given on the command line. These files may be
  located in the user specific [5XGAP[105X root directory [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X which by
  default  is  the  first  [5XGAP[105X root directory, see [14X'Reference: The gap.ini and
  gaprc  files'[114X.  For  compatibility,  the  [11X.gaprc[111X  file  is still read if the
  directory  [10XGAPInfo.UserGapRoot[110X  does  not  exist. See [14X'Reference: The former
  .gaprc file'[114X for the instructions how to migrate your old setup.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore, there are functions to deal with user preferences, for example,
  to  specify  how  [5XGAP[105X's  online help is shown or whether the coloured prompt
  should  be  used.  Calls  to  set  user preferences may appear in the user's
  [11Xgap.ini[111X file, as explained in [14X'Reference: Configuring User preferences'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  Windows  version,  we  include  a  new  shell which uses the [5Xmintty[105X
  terminal in addition to the two previously used shells (Windows command line
  and [5XRXVT[105X). The [5Xmintty[105X shell is now recommended. It supports Unicode encoding
  and  has flexible configurations options. Also, [5XGAP[105X under Windows now starts
  in  the [11X%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%[111X directory, which is the user's home directory.
  Besides  this,  a larger workspace is now permitted without a need to modify
  the Windows registry.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOther changes in the user interface include:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ythe  command  line history is now implemented at the [5XGAP[105X level, it can
        be  stored  on  quitting  a [5XGAP[105X session and reread when starting a new
        session, see [14X'Reference: The command line history'[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[10XSetPrintFormattingStatus("stdout",false);[110X  may  be  used to switch off
        the    automatic    line    breaking    in    terminal   output,   see
        [2XSetPrintFormattingStatus[102X ([14XReference: SetPrintFormattingStatus[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGAP[105X  supports terminals with up to 4096 columns (extendable at compile
        time).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDirectories  in  [10X-l[110X  command-line option can now be specified starting
        with [10X~/[110X, see [14X'Reference: Command Line Options'[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YLarge  integers  are now displayed by a short string showing the first
        and  last  few  digits, and the threshold to trigger this behaviour is
        user  configurable  (call  [10XUserPreference("MaxBitsIntView")[110X to see the
        default value).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe [5XGAP[105X banner has been made more compact and informative.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[2XSetHelpViewer[102X  ([14XReference:  SetHelpViewer[114X)  now  supports  the  Google
        Chrome browser.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YMultiple  matches  in the [5XGAP[105X online help are displayed via a function
        from the [5XBrowse[105X package, which is loaded in the default configuration.
        This feature can be replaced by the known pager using the command[133X
  
  SetUserPreference( "browse", "SelectHelpMatches", false );
  
  
  [1X4.1-4 [33X[0;0YBetter documentation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  main  [5XGAP[105X  manuals have been converted to the [5XGAPDoc[105X format provided by
  the    [5XGAPDoc[105X    package    by    Frank    Lübeck    and    Max   Neunhöffer
  ([7Xhttp://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc[107X).  This  documentation
  format  is  already used by many packages and is now recommended for all [5XGAP[105X
  documentation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBesides  improvements  to the documentation layout in all formats (text, PDF
  and  HTML),  the  new [5XGAP[105X manuals incorporate a large number of corrections,
  clarifications, additions and updated examples.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  now  provide  two  HTML versions of the manual, one of them with [5XMathJax[105X
  ([7Xhttp://www.mathjax.org[107X) support for better display of mathematical symbols.
  Also, there are two PDF versions of the manual - a coloured and a monochrome
  one.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSeveral separate manuals now became parts of the [5XGAP[105X Reference manual. Thus,
  now there are three main [5XGAP[105X manual books:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[13X[5XGAP[105X Tutorial[113X[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  there is no index file combining these three manuals. Instead of

  [1X4.2 [33X[0;0YPackages in [5XGAP[105X[101X[1X 4.5[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  we  list  most important changes affecting packages and present new or
  essentially  changed  packages.  For the changes in the core [5XGAP[105X system, see
  Section [14X4.1[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.2-1 [33X[0;0YInterface between the core system and packages[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  loading  mechanism  has  been improved. The most important new
  feature  is  that all dependencies are evaluated in advance and then used to
  determine  the  order  in  which  package files are read. This allows [5XGAP[105X to
  handle  cyclic  dependencies  as well as situations where package A requires
  package  B  to be loaded completely before any file of package A is read. To
  avoid  distortions  of  the  order in which packages will be loaded, package
  authors  are  strongly  discouraged  from  calling  [2XLoadPackage[102X  ([14XReference:
  LoadPackage[114X)         and         [2XTestPackageAvailability[102X         ([14XReference:
  TestPackageAvailability[114X)  in  a  package  code in order to determine whether
  some  other  package  will  be  loaded  before  or together with the current
  package  -  instead,  one  should  use [2XIsPackageMarkedForLoading[102X ([14XReference:
  IsPackageMarkedForLoading[114X).  In  addition,  there  is  now  a  better  error
  management   if  package  loading  fails  for  packages  that  use  the  new
  functionality  to log package loading messages (see [2XDisplayPackageLoadingLog[102X
  ([14XReference:   DisplayPackageLoadingLog[114X)   and   the   rest  of  the  Chapter
  [14X'Reference:  Using  GAP  Packages'[114X which documents how to [13Xuse[113X [5XGAP[105X packages),
  and   package  authors  are  very  much  encouraged  to  use  these  logging
  facilities.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  [5XGAP[105X  4.4 certain packages were marked as [13Xautoloaded[113X and would be loaded,
  if  present,  when  [5XGAP[105X  started up. In [5XGAP[105X 4.5, this notion is divided into
  three.  Certain packages are recorded as [13Xneeded[113X by the [5XGAP[105X system and others
  as  [13Xsuggested[113X,  in  the  same  way  that  packages may [13Xneed[113X or [13Xsuggest[113X other
  packages. If a needed package is not loadable, [5XGAP[105X will not start. Currently
  only  [5XGAPDoc[105X  is  needed.  If  a  suggested  package is loadable, it will be
  loaded.  Typically  these  are  packages  which  install  better methods for
  Operations and Objects already present in [5XGAP[105X. Finally, the user preferences
  mechanism  can  be used to specify additional packages that should be loaded
  if  possible. By default this includes most packages that were autoloaded in
  [5XGAP[105X 4.4.12, see [2XShowUserPreferences[102X ([14XReference: ShowUserPreferences[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  packages  may now use local [13Xnamespaces[113X to avoid name clashes for global
  variables   introduced  in  other  packages  or  in  the  [5XGAP[105X  library,  see
  [14X'Reference: Namespaces for GAP packages'[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  guidance  on  how to [13Xdevelop[113X a [5XGAP[105X package has been consolidated in the
  [5XExample[105X  package which also contains a checklist for upgrading a [5XGAP[105X package
  to [5XGAP[105X 4.5, see [14X'Example: Guidelines for Writing a GAP Package'[114X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YAt   the  time  of  the  release  of  [5XGAP[105X  4.4.12  there  were  75  packages
  redistributed  with  [5XGAP[105X  (including the [5XTomLib[105X which was distributed in the

  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XCTblLib[105X  package  (the  [5XGAP[105X  Character Table Library) by T. Breuer has
        been  extended  by  many  new  character  tables, a few bugs have been
        fixed,  and  new  features have been added, for example concerning the
        relation  to  [5XGAP[105X's  group  libraries,  better  search facilities, and
        interactive overviews. For details, see the package manual.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XDESIGN[105X package by L.H. Soicher:[133X

        [30X    [33X[0;12YThe  layout of the text version of the manuals can be configured
              quite  freely, several standard [21Xthemes[121X are provided. The display

        [30X    [33X[0;12YThe  text  and HTML versions of manuals make more use of unicode
              characters  (but  the text version is also still reasonably good

        [30X    [33X[0;12YThe PDF version of the manuals uses better fonts.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YOf course, there are various improvements for authors of manuals

              ExtractExamples[114X)   and  [2XRunExamples[102X  ([14XGAPDoc:  RunExamples[114X)  for
              automatic testing and correcting of manual examples.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGpd[105X  package  by  E.J.  Moore  and C.D. Wensley has been substantially
        rewritten. The main extensions provide functions for:[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YSubgroupoids  of  a direct product with complete graph groupoid,
              specified by a root group and choice of rays.[133X

              and  isomorphism  testing  functions. An automorphism of a graph
              with  colour-classes  is  an  automorphism  of  the  graph which
              additionally  preserves  the list of colour-classes (classwise),
              and  an  isomorphism  from  one  graph  with colour-classes to a
              second is a graph isomorphism from the first graph to the second
              which  additionally maps the first list of colour-classes to the
              second (classwise).[133X

        [22X65536[122X).  It also has faster group recognition and adds a few omissions
        for [22XGL(3,8)[122X and [22XGL(6,5)[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XParGAP[105X package by G. Cooperman is now compiled using a system-wide MPI
        implementation by default to facilitate running it on proper clusters.
        There  is  also  an option to build it with the [5XMPINU[105X library which is
        still  supplied  with  the  package  (thanks to P. Smith for upgrading

  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XRCWA[105X  package by S. Kohl among the new features and other improvements
        has the following:[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YA   database   of   all   52394  groups  generated  by  3  class
              transpositions  of  [22Xℤ[122X  which  interchange  residue  classes with
              modulus  less  than  or  equal  to 6. This database contains the
              orders  and  the moduli of all of these groups. Also it provides
              information  on  what  is  known about which of these groups are
              equal and how their finite and infinite orbits on [22Xℤ[122X look like.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YMore  routines  for investigating the action of an rcwa group on
              [22Xℤ[122X.  Examples  are a routine which attempts to find out whether a
              given  rcwa  group  acts  transitively on the set of nonnegative
              integers  in  its  support  and a routine which looks for finite
              orbits on the set of all residue classes of [22Xℤ[122X.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YAbility to deal with rcwa permutations of [22Xℤ^2[122X.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YImportant  methods  have  been  made  more efficient in terms of
              runtime and memory consumption.[133X
  
        [30X    [33X[0;12YThe output has been improved. For example, rcwa permutations are
              now [10XDisplay[110X'ed in ASCII text resembling LaTeX output.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  [5XXGAP[105X  package  by  F. Celler and M. Neunhöffer can now be used on
        64-bit  architectures  (thanks  to N. Eldredge and M. Horn for sending
        patches).  Furthermore,  there is now an export to XFig option (thanks
        to  Russ  Woodroofe  for this patch). The help system in [5XXGAP[105X has been
        adjusted to [5XGAP[105X 4.5.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YAdditionally,  some  packages with kernel modules or external binaries
        are  now  available  in  Windows.  The  [11X-win.zip[111X  archive  and the [5XGAP[105X

  [33X[0;0YOther fixed bugs:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFixed  a bug in [2XCommutatorSubgroup[102X ([14XReference: CommutatorSubgroup[114X) for
        fp  groups  causing  infinite  recursion, which could, for example, be
        triggered by computing automorphism groups.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YPreviously, the list of factors of a polynomial was mutable, and hence
        could   be   accidentally  corrupted  by  callers.  Now  the  list  of
        irreducible  factors  is  stored  immutable.  To  deal  with  implicit
        reliance  on old code, always a shallow copy is returned. [reported by
        Jakob Kroeker][133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YComputing  high  powers  of matrices ran into an error for matrices in
        the  format  of  the [5Xcvec[105X package. Now the library function also works
        with these matrices. [reported by Klaus Lux][133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe pseudo tty code which is responsible for spawning subprocesses has
        been  partially  rewritten  to  allow  more  than  128 subprocesses on
        certain  systems.  This  mechanism is for example used by [5XANUPQ[105X and [5Xnq[105X
        packages   to   compute  group  quotients  via  an  external  program.
        Previously,  on  Mac  OS X this could be done precisely 128 times, and
        then  an  error  would  occur.  That  is,  one  could e.g. compute 128
        nilpotent quotients, and then had to restart [5XGAP[105X to compute more. This
        also  affected other systems, such as OpenBSD, where it now also works
        correctly.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOn Mac OS X, using [5XGAP[105X compiled against GNU readline 6.2, pasting text
        into  the  terminal  session  would result in this text appearing very
        slowly,  with  a 0.1 sec delay between each [21Xkeystroke[121X. This is not the
        case  with  versions  6.1  and older, and has been reported to the GNU
        readline  team.  In  the  meantime,  we work around this issue in most
        situations  by  setting  [10Xrl_event_hook[110X only if [10XOnCharReadHookActive[110X is
        set.[133X

        [10X"InfoPackageLoadingLevel"[110X was set to a number [22X>= 3[122X. The reason is that
        [10XPrintFormattedString[110X  was  called before it was installed. The current
        fix is a temporary solution.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe [10X"hints"[110X member of [10XTypOutputFile[110X used to contain 3*100 entries, yet
