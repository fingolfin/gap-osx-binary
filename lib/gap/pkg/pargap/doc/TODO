Can allow messages to be sent to self:  SendMsg(42, 0)
  but the error checking stops it, and we would have to verify that
  messages are evaluated when being sent to self (just as they are
  when sent to a slave).  Would anybody care?

The following works:
gap> SendMsg("SendMsg(42, 2)", 1);
gap> SendMsg("RecvMsg(1)", 2);    
gap> RecvMsg();
"<no_return_val>"
gap> RecvMsg();
42
But in one experiment, quit; seemed to hang afterwards.  Check that out
before publicly adding the above to the README.

InitializeGap passes &argc, but only argv instead off &argv.
This can cause problems for some other MPIs, and I had to patch
src/gapmpi.c to make sure this continued to work in the latest version.
When this works, I can safely replace insertNoBanner by:
  doc/test-insertNoBanner.c-future
and allow ParGAP to work with any MPI.
