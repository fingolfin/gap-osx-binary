\Chapter{Comments?}

*COMMENTS SOLICITED:*

I welcome comments on how  well  the  TOP-C  parallel  model  fits  other
applications. I am also interested in building up a library of  {\ParGAP}
programs that  can  be  made  available  to  other  users.  Finally,  one
ingredient in making a system usabe is a good choice of names that  makes
the purpose of  various  commands  obvious  to  a  new  user.  I  welcome
suggestions. For example, `ParEval', `BroadcastMsg',  `SendRecvMsg',  and
`SendMsg' all have related functionalities.  The  same  can  be  said  of
`RecvMsg', `ProbeMsg', `ProbeMsgNonBlocking'. Hence,  a  more  orthogonal
naming scheme might be easier.

If you are interested in ``looking over my  shoulder'',  you  might  also
want to inspect some of my random scribbling  in  the  {\ParGAP}'s  `etc'
subdirectory.

% TODO:
% 1) Can talk a little about CONTINUATION_ACTION(), RawMasterSlave() and
%     futures and shared memory,
%    and multiple environments, and dynamically joining processes, Beowulf, etc.
% 2)  malloc issues (okay?)
% 3)  "<string_buf>;_<int_dest>[;_<opt_int_tag_=_0>_]"
%    Make some things immutable, masslave.g, and MPI_TAG_UB, etc. in pargapmpi.c?
% 4)  MPI_Type_size(), tags in any order (pool of buffers)
% 5)  ^C or InterruptSlave(1) gives weird error:
%   Maybe this will go away in GAP 4.x, which allows empty statements.
% Syntax error: expression expected in stream line 1
%  y^
% This message should be ignored.  If on the master inside a "brk>" loop,
%  type "quit;" to leave the break loop.
