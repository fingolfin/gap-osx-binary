# The line, "local 0", is obligatory.  It implies creation of the local master.

# After that, there is one line per slave.
#Example:
# procyon.ccs.neu.edu 1 @PWD@/bin/pargap.sh

# The first field is the hostname or localhost (in a form valid for "rsh")
# The second field, 1, is obligatory.
# The format is inherited from MPICH, which grew from P4.

#=========================================================================
# IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
# MPINU uses "rsh" to start a slave process.  Diagnose it via:
#   rsh REMOTE_SLAVE_HOST hostname
# If it doesn't work or if it asks you for a password, try:
#   1.  Add a .rhosts file on the remote host and specify your local host.
#   2.  Sometimes adding  .localhost  to your .rhosts helps.
#   3.  Specify an alternative to "rsh" in your shell.  For example:
#       RSH=ssh; export  # in Bourne shell, bash, etc.
#       setenv RSH ssh   # in csh, tcsh, etc.
#   4.  If you use "ssh", you may also need to copy keys to allow
#       login to the remote host without a password.
# It's also possible that mpinu guessed badly the hostname of your local host.
# If you suspect this, try:
#   CALLBACK_HOST=LOCAL_MASTER _HOST
#   where LOCAL_MASTER_HOST is the correct hostname of the local master.
