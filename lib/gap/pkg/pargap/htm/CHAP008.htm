<h1>8 Comments?</h1><p>
<p>
<strong>COMMENTS SOLICITED:</strong>
<p>
I welcome comments on how  well  the  TOP-C  parallel  model  fits  other
applications. I am also interested in building up a library of  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ParGAP</font>
programs that  can  be  made  available  to  other  users.  Finally,  one
ingredient in making a system usabe is a good choice of names that  makes
the purpose of  various  commands  obvious  to  a  new  user.  I  welcome
suggestions. For example, <code>ParEval</code>, <code>BroadcastMsg</code>,  <code>SendRecvMsg</code>,  and
<code>SendMsg</code> all have related functionalities.  The  same  can  be  said  of
<code>RecvMsg</code>, <code>ProbeMsg</code>, <code>ProbeMsgNonBlocking</code>. Hence,  a  more  orthogonal
naming scheme might be easier.
<p>
If you are interested in ``looking over my  shoulder'',  you  might  also
want to inspect some of my random scribbling  in  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ParGAP</font>'s  <code>etc</code>
subdirectory.
