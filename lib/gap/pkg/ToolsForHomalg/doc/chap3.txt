  [33X[0;0YThe  first  argument  is  the  [3Xindicator[103X.  It  is  a list of sources like in
  ToDoListEntry.  Each  entry [3XSP[103X has to be a threetuple. First entry of [3XSP[103X has
  to  an object, for which the second entry of [3XSP[103X, which has to be the name of
  an  attribute, must become known. Once the attribute is known to the object,
  it  will  be  compared  to the third entry of the list. This can be a value,
  which  is  compared  directly  a  function, which is launched and its return
  value is compared, or a list, consisting of a function and arguments, so the
  return  value  of the function with given arguments is compared. If there is

  are  installed  for  the two entries of the list [3Xobjects[103X which can either be
  the  objects  itself  or  a  list containing a function and arguments, which
  return  value  is  used.  For  each  entry  in  [3Xattributes[103X  such an entry is
  installed. Such an entry can be the name of an attribute, if both objects in
