  <Oper Arg="indicator, objects, attributes" Name="ToDoListEntryToMaintainEqualAttributes" Label="for IsList, IsList, IsList"/>
 <Returns> a todo list entry
</Returns>
 <Description>
 The first argument is the <A>indicator</A>.
 It is a list of sources like in ToDoListEntry.
 Each entry <A>SP</A> has to be a threetuple.
 First entry of <A>SP</A> has to an object, for
 which the second entry of <A>SP</A>, which has
 to be the name of an attribute, must become known.
 Once the attribute is known to the object,
 it will be compared to the third entry of the list.
 This can be a value, which is compared directly
 a function, which is launched and its return value is compared,
 or a list, consisting of a function and arguments, so the
 return value of the function with given arguments is compared.
 If there is no third entry in <A>SP</A>, it is only looked
 up if the value is known. Once all entries in <A>indicator</A>
 are processed like this, and all returned true in the comparasion,
 a list of ToDoListEntryForEqualAttributes is installed.
 They are installed for the two entries of the list <A>objects</A>
 which can either be the objects itself or a list
 containing a function and arguments, which return
 value is used. For each entry in <A>attributes</A> such
 an entry is installed. Such an entry can be the
 name of an attribute, if both objects
 in <A>objects</A> should share the value
 between attributes with the same name, or a list
 of two names, if the attributes do not have
 the same name.

  <Oper Arg="indicator, objects, attributes" Name="ToDoListEntryToMaintainFollowingAttributes" Label="for IsList, IsList, IsList"/>
 <Returns> a todo list entry
</Returns>
 <Description>
 This function creates a ToDoListEntry which can
 install several ToDoListEntries.
 The first two arguments, <A>indicator</A> and <A>objects</A>
 except that there will be only ToDoListEntries
 installed between the two objects in <A>objects</A>.
 Each entry in <A>attributes</A> can either be a string
 which means that the attribute with the given name will be set
 from the first to the second object in <A>objects</A>
 once it is known.
 The third argument <A>attributes</A> is a list of attributes
 that will be propagated by ToDoListEntries.
 Each entry <A>TP</A> can either be a list consisting of
 a DescriptionOfImplication string and one of the following
 or just one of the following lists:
 It can be a string, which means that the Attribute
 with the given name will be propagated from the first to
 the second object.
 It can be a list, consisting of two entries, where the first entry
 is a list of sources like in ToDoListEntry
 and the second might be a function
 which will be launched once the first part is fulfilled.
 It can also be a threetuple which will serve
 as second to fourth argument of ToDoListEntry.
 Or it can be a string, which will set the attribute named
 like this of the first object to the one named in the second object

  <Oper Arg="source, target_list" Name="ToDoListEntry" Label="for IsList, IsList"/>
 <Returns> a todo list entry
</Returns>
 <Description>
 This function allows to create more than one
 ToDoListEntry with identical list of sources at one time.
 First argument is a list of sources like in the other ToDoListEntry functions
 Second argument is a list of threetuples,
 which serve as second to fourth argument of ToDoListEntry
 or a function, which serves as second argument for ToDoListEntry
 or a tuple with a description string and one of the above.

 <Returns> nothing
</Returns>
 <Description>
 This function installs an immediate method
 which can install ToDoListEntryToMaintainEqualAttributes.
 First argument must be a filter, and once the filter becomes true
 the ToDoListEntryToMaintainEqualAttributes is
 installed with the second to fourth argument
 as first to third.
 In those attributes, at any point,
 the variable ToDoList_this_object
 can be used. When the entry is installed
 This will be replaced with the object to which the
 filters became known, i.e. the one which triggered the
 immediate method.

</Returns>
 <Description>
 The first argument must be a list consisting of two, three or four-tuples
 where the first entry must be the object to which the attribute
 given as a string in the second entry must be known to process this entry.
 The second entry can also be a list of strings, in that case all the
 attributes given as names must be known.
 Also, in this case, only two entries in this tuple are allowed.
 The third part can be a value or a list, consisting of a function followed
 by arguments which will be computed by the time the attribute given
 as second entry becomes known to the first entry.
 If the second part is only a string, and there is a third entry in the tuple
 the attribute is compared to the third entry.
 One can set a comparating function as fourth entry, which must
 take two entries and return false or true.
 If the value of the attribute matches the (computed)
 value in the third entry for all members of the list in the first argument
 the attribute given as third argument, also by name, of the second argument
 is set to the value of the fourth argument.
