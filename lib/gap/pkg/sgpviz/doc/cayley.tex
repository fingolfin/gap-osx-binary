#M RightCayleyGraph(M)  # Computes the right Cayley graph of the
 monoid M. (It is returned as an automaton without initial and final states.)

#F  AutCayley # The first argument is the Cayley graph of a monoid and
 the second an element of the monoid (more precisely, the position of
 that element in the list of the elements of the monoid). It produces
 an automaton whose initial state is the identity the final state is x.
