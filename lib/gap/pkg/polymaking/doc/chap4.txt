  [1X4.1 The General Method[0X
  
  When  polymake  is called, its output is read as a string and then processed
  as follows:
  
  (1)   the  lines  containing upper case letters are found. These are treated
        as  lines  containing  the  keywords.  Each  of  those lines marks the
        beginning of a block of data.
  
  (2)   The  string  is  then  cut  into a list of blocks (also strings). Each
        block  starts  with  a  line containing the keyword and continues with
        some lines of data.
  
  (3)   for  each  of the blocks, the appropriate function of [10XObjectConverters[0m
        is  called.  Here  "appropriate"  just  means, that the keyword of the
        block coincides with the name of the function.
  
  (4)   The  output  of  the  conversion  function  is then added to the known
        properties of the [10XPolymakeObject[0m for which [10XPolymake[0m was called.
  
  
  [1X4.1-1 Converter- Philosopy[0X
  
  The converter functions should take meaningful polymake data into meaningful
  [5XGAP[0m  data.  This  sometimes  means that the (mathematical) representation is
  changed.  Here  is  an  example: polymake writes vectors as augmented affine
  vectors of the form [10X1 a1 a2 a3...[0m which does not go very well with the usual
  [5XGAP[0m  conventions  of column vectors and multiplying matrices from the right.
  So  [5Xpolymaking[0m converts such a vector to [10X[a1,a2,a3,...][0m and the user is left
  with the problem of augmentation and left or right multiplication.
  
  Another  area  where  the  [5XGAP[0m  object  isn't a literal translation from the
  polymake  world  is combinatorics. In Polymake, list elements are enumerated
  starting  from  0.  [5XGAP[0m  enumerates  lists  starting at 1. So the conversion
  process  adds 1 to the numbers corresponding to vertices in facet lists, for
  example.
  
  The conversion process is done by the following methods:
  
  [1X4.1-2 ConvertPolymakeOutputToGapNotation[0m
  
  [2X> ConvertPolymakeOutputToGapNotation( [0X[3Xstring[0X[2X ) _______________________[0Xmethod
  [6XReturns:[0X  Record  having polymake keywords as entry names and the respective
            converted polymake output as entries.
  
  Given  a  the output of the polymake program as a string [3Xstring[0m, this method
  first  calls  [2XSplitPolymakeOutputStringIntoBlocks[0m  ([14X4.1-3[0m).  For each of the
  returned  blocks, the name (=first line) of the block is read and the record
  [2XObjectConverters[0m  ([14X4.1-4[0m)  is looked up for an entry with that name. If such
  an  entry exists, it (being a function!) is called and passed the block. The
  returned  value  is then given the name of the block and added to the record
  returned by [10XConvertPolymakeOutputToGapNotation[0m.

  [2X> SplitPolymakeOutputStringIntoBlocks( [0X[3Xstring[0X[2X ) ______________________[0Xmethod
  [6XReturns:[0X  List of strings -- "blocks"--
  
  The  string [3Xstring[0m is cut at the lines starting with an upper case character
  and  consisting  only  of  upper  case  letters,  numbers and underscore (_)
  characters.  The parts are returned as a list of strings. The initial string
  [3Xstring[0m remains unchanged.

  [2X> ObjectConverters___________________________________________[0Xglobal variable
  
  The  entries  of  this  record are labeled by polymake keywords. Each of the
  entries  is  a  function which converts a string returned by polymake to [5XGAP[0m
  format.  So  far,  only  a few converters are implemented. To see which, try
  [10XRecNames(ObjectConverters);[0m
  
  You can define new converters using the basic functions described in section
  [14X4.2[0m.
  
  
  [1X4.2 Conversion Functions[0X
  
  The  following  functions  are  used  for  the functions in [2XObjectConverters[0m
  ([14X4.1-4[0m).

  [2X> ConvertPolymakeNumber( [0X[3Xstring[0X[2X ) ____________________________________[0Xmethod
  
  The  string  [3Xstring[0m is converted to a rational number. Unlike [10XRat[0m, it tests,
  if  the  number represented by [3Xstring[0m is a floating point number an converts
  it correctly. If this is the case, a waring is issued.

  [2X> ConvertPolymakeScalarToGAP( [0X[3Xlist[0X[2X ) _________________________________[0Xmethod
  
  If  [3Xlist[0m  contains  a  single string, this string is converted into a number
  using [2XConvertPolymakeNumber[0m ([14X4.2-1[0m).
  
  [1X4.2-3 ConvertPolymakeMatrixOrListOfSetsToGAP[0m
  
  [2X> ConvertPolymakeMatrixOrListOfSetsToGAP( [0X[3Xlist[0X[2X ) _____________________[0Xmethod
  [2X> ConvertPolymakeMatrixOrListOfSetsToGAPPlusOne( [0X[3Xlist[0X[2X ) ______________[0Xmethod
  
  Tries to decide if the list [3Xlist[0m of strings represents a matrix or a list of
  sets   by   testing   if   they   start  with  "{".  It  then  calls  either
  [2XConvertPolymakeMatrixToGAP[0m    ([14X4.2-4[0m)    or   [2XConvertPolymakeListOfSetsToGAP[0m
  ([14X4.2-8[0m).  The  "PlusOne" version calls [2XConvertPolymakeListOfSetsToGAPPlusOne[0m
  ([14X4.2-8[0m) if [3Xlist[0m represents a list of sets.

  The  list  [3Xlist[0m  of  strings  is  interpreted  as  a list of row vectors and
  converted into a matrix. The "KillOnes" version removes the leading ones.

  [9XConvertPolymakeIntVectorToGAPPlusOne[0m   requires   the   vector   to  contain
  integers. It also adds 1 to every entry.

  [2X> ConvertPolymakeBoolToGAP( [0X[3Xlist[0X[2X ) ___________________________________[0Xmethod
  
  If  [3Xlist[0m  contains  a single string, which is either 0,false,1, or true this
  function returns [9Xfalse[0m or [9Xtrue[0m, respectively.

  Let  [3Xlist[0m  be  a list containing a single string, which is a list of numbers
  separated  by  whitespaces  and  enclosed by { and } . The returned value is
  then a set of rational numbers (in the GAP sense).

  Let  [3Xlist[0m  be a list containing several strings representing sets. Then each
  of  these strings is converted to a set of rational numbers and the returned
  value  is  the list of all those sets. The "PlusOne" version adds 1 to every
  entry.
