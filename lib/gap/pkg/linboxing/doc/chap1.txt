  
  [1X1 Introduction[0X
  
  The LinBox C++ library ([7Xhttp://www.linalg.org[0m) performs exact linear algebra
  and  provides  a set of routines for the solution of linear algebra problems
  such  as  rank, determinant, and the solution of linear systems. It provides
  representations  for both sparse and dense matrices over integers and finite
  fields.  It has a particular emphasis on black-box matrix methods (which are
  very  efficient  over  sparse  matrices),  but  increasingly  also  provides
  elimination-based  routines  for  dense matrices using the industry-standard
  BLAS numeric routines.
  
  [5XGAP[0m  ([7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org[0m)  is  a  system  for  computational discrete
  algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory. It provides
  good implementations of exact linear algebra routines on dense matrices over
  all  common  fields  and  the integers. Typically, [5XGAP[0m's versions are faster
  than  LinBox  for small finite fields (i.e. order less than 256), but LinBox
  is much faster for larger finite fields and the integers.
  
  The  [5Xlinboxing[0m  (LinBox-in-GAP)  package provides an interface to the LinBox
  C++ library from [5XGAP[0m. It provides alternative versions of [5XGAP[0m linear algebra
  routines  which are mapped through to the equivalent LinBox library routines
  at the [5XGAP[0m kernel level. The functions provided by the [5Xlinboxing[0m package are
  named  the  same  as  the  [5XGAP[0m equivalents, but are all contained within the
  [10XLinBox[0m  record,  and  so are prefixed with `[10XLinBox.[0m'. The functions provided
  are
  
  --    [2XLinBox.Determinant[0m ([14X3.1-1[0m)
  
  --    [2XLinBox.Rank[0m ([14X3.1-2[0m)
  
  --    [2XLinBox.Trace[0m ([14X3.1-3[0m)
  
  --    [2XLinBox.SolutionMat[0m ([14X3.1-4[0m)
  
  over the integers and prime fields.
  
  The  linear  algebra  routines provided by the [5Xlinboxing[0m package are, in the
  majority  of  cases,  considerably  faster than the native [5XGAP[0m versions, and
  scale better with matrix size. This speed is at the expense of memory, since
  the  [5XGAP[0m matrices and vector must be copied into a memory format that LinBox
  can use.
  
  
  [1X1.1 Sample timings[0X
  
  The  tables below give typical timings when performing operations on a 500 x
  500 matrix. All of the timings given below were performed on a 3.20GHz Intel
  Core  i7  Linux  machine  using  [5XGAP[0m version 4.4.12 and version 0.5.2 of the
  [5Xlinboxing[0m  package. The tests consider the various equivalent methods in [5XGAP[0m
  and   [5Xlinboxing[0m,   and  the  various  different  data  representations  used
  internally by [5XGAP[0m
  
  The  most  dramatic  speedups  are  seen for matrices of integers, where the
  [5Xlinboxing[0m  routines  are  significantly  faster. It is also faster for large
  prime  fields,  but  [5XGAP[0m  is  better for small finite fields due to its very
  efficient  internal  representation of those fields. These observations hold
  for all Rank, Determinant and SolutionMat calculations, but the Trace method
  is so simple that it appears to be always faster to use [5XGAP[0m
  
  These  timings  are offered as guidelines. The speedup should be larger with
  larger  matrices,  but  a  gain  can also be seen with much smaller matrices
  (e.g.  the  Rank  of  a  15  x 15 integer matrix). The user is encouraged to
  perform  their own timing experiments to assess the likely gain in their own
  cases.
