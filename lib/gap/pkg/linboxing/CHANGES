  Now only works with LinBox 1.1.7 and LinBox 1.1.6, to simplify maintenance.

Version 0.5.1: 2008/04/23
  First deposited version. Minimal version of LinBox changed to 1.1.5, which
  works out of the box with no patch, simplifying the installation of linboxing.

  First release. Supports DeterminantMat, TraceMat, RankMat and SolutionMat
  over integers and prime fields. Works with LinBox 1.1.4 using the supplied

(Note: earlier in development, this package was called simply `LinBox', 
with version numbers up to and including 0.8. These are all superseded by this
`linboxing' package)
