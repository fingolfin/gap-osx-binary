\section*{Abstract}
\logpage{[ 0, 0, 2 ]}
 The \textsf{Semigroups} package is a \textsf{GAP} package containing methods for semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroups,
principally of transformations, partial permutations, bipartitions,
subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups, and the free inverse
semigroup. 

 \textsf{Semigroups} contains more efficient methods than those available in the \textsf{GAP} library (and in many cases more efficient than any other software) for
creating semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroup, calculating their Green's
structure, ideals, size, elements, group of units, small generating sets,
testing membership, finding the inverses of a regular element, factorizing
elements over the generators, and many more. It is also possible to test if a
semigroup satisfies a particular property, such as if it is regular, simple,
inverse, completely regular, and a variety of further properties. 

 There are methods for finding congruences of certain types of semigroups, the
normalizer of a semigroup in a permutation group, the maximal subsemigroups of
a finite semigroup, and smaller degree partial permutation representations and
the character tables of inverse semigroups. There are functions for producing
pictures of the Green's structure of a semigroup, and for drawing
bipartitions. \mbox{}}\\[1cm]

\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Introduction}}\logpage{[ 1, 1, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7DFB63A97E67C0A1}{}
{
 This is the manual for the \textsf{Semigroups} package version 2.0. \textsf{Semigroups} 2.0 is a descendant of the \href{ http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html} {Monoid package for GAP 3} by Goetz Pfeiffer, Steve A. Linton, Edmund F. Robertson, and Nik Ruskuc; and
the Monoid package for GAP 4 by J. D. Mitchell.

 Many of the operations, methods, properties, and functions described in this
manual only apply to semigroups of transformations, partial permutations,
bipartitions, and subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over
groups. For the sake of brevity, we have opted to say \textsc{semigroup} rather than \textsc{semigroup of transformations, partial permutations, bipartitions, and
subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups over groups}.

 \textsf{Semigroups} 2.0 contains more efficient methods than those available in the \textsf{GAP} library (and in many cases more efficient than any other software) for
creating semigroups and ideals, calculating their Green's structure, size,
elements, group of units, minimal ideal, and testing membership, finding the
inverses of a regular element, and factorizing elements over the generators,
and many more; see Chapters \ref{create}, \ref{Ideals}, and \ref{green}. There are also methods for testing if a semigroup satisfies a particular
property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse, completely regular, and a
variety of further properties; see Chapter \ref{green}. The theory behind the main algorithms in \textsf{Semigroups} will be described in a forthcoming article. 

 It is harder for \textsf{Semigroups} to compute Green's $\mathcal{L}$- and $\mathcal{H}$-classes of a transformation semigroup and the methods used to compute with
Green's $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{D}$-classes are the most efficient in \textsf{Semigroups}. Thus, if you are computing with a transformation semigroup, wherever
possible, it is advisable to use the commands relating to Green's $\mathcal{R}$- or $\mathcal{D}$-classes rather than those relating to Green's $\mathcal{L}$- or $\mathcal{H}$-classes. No such difficulties are present when computing with semigroups of
partial permutations, bipartitions, or subsemigroups of a regular Rees
0-matrix semigroup over a group.

 The methods in \textsf{Semigroups} allow the computation of individual Green's classes without computing the
entire data structure of the underlying semigroup; see \texttt{GreensRClassOfElementNC} (\ref{GreensRClassOfElementNC}). It is also possible to compute the $\mathcal{R}$-classes, the number of elements and test membership in a semigroup without
computing all the elements; see, for example, \texttt{GreensRClasses} (\ref{GreensRClasses}), \texttt{RClassReps} (\ref{RClassReps}), \texttt{IteratorOfRClassReps} (\ref{IteratorOfRClassReps}), \texttt{IteratorOfRClasses} (\ref{IteratorOfRClasses}), or \texttt{NrRClasses} (\ref{NrRClasses}). This may be useful if you want to study a very large semigroup where
computing all the elements of the semigroup is not feasible.

 There are methods for finding: congruences of certain types of semigroups
(based on Section 3.5 in \cite{howie}), the normalizer of a semigroup in a permutation group (as given in \cite{Araujo2010aa}), the maximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup (based on \cite{Graham1968aa}), smaller degree partial permutation representations (based on \cite{Schein1992aa}) and the character table of an inverse semigroup. There are functions for
producing pictures of the Green's structure of a semigroup, and for drawing
bipartitions. 

 Several standard examples of semigroups are provided see Section \ref{Examples}. \textsf{Semigroups} also provides functions to read and write collections of transformations,
partial permutations, and bipartitions to a file; see \texttt{ReadGenerators} (\ref{ReadGenerators}) and \texttt{WriteGenerators} (\ref{WriteGenerators}).

 Details of how to create and manipulate semigroups of bipartitions can be
found in Chapter \ref{bipartition}.

 There are also functions in \textsf{Semigroups} to define and manipulate free inverse semigroups and their elements; this part
of the package was written by Julius Jonu{\v s}as; see Chapter \ref{Free inverse semigroups} and Section 5.10 in \cite{howie} for more details.

 \textsf{Semigroups} contains functions synonymous to some of those defined in the \textsf{GAP} library but, for the sake of convenience, they have abbreviated names; further
details can be found at the appropriate points in the later chapters of this
manual. 

 \textsf{Semigroups} contains different methods for some \textsf{GAP} library functions, and so you might notice that \textsf{GAP} behaves differently when \textsf{Semigroups} is loaded. For more details about semigroups in \textsf{GAP} or Green's relations in particular, see  (\textbf{Reference: Semigroups}) or  (\textbf{Reference: Green's Relations}).

 The \textsf{Semigroups} package is written \textsf{GAP} code and requires the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} and \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html } {IO} packages. The \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} package is used to efficiently compute components of actions, which underpin
many of the features of \textsf{Semigroups}. The \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html } {IO} package is used to read and write transformations, partial permutations, and
bipartitions to a file. 

 The \href{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/} {Grape} package must be loaded for the operation \texttt{SmallestMultiplicationTable} (\ref{SmallestMultiplicationTable}) to work, and it must be fully compiled for the following functions to work: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{MunnSemigroup} (\ref{MunnSemigroup}) 
\item  \texttt{MaximalSubsemigroups} (\ref{MaximalSubsemigroups:for an acting semigroup}) 
\item  \texttt{IsIsomorphicSemigroup} (\ref{IsIsomorphicSemigroup}) 
\item  \texttt{IsomorphismSemigroups} (\ref{IsomorphismSemigroups}). 
\end{itemize}
 If \href{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/} {Grape} is not available or is not compiled, then \textsf{Semigroups} can be used as normal with the exception that the functions above will not
work. 

 The \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} package is used in one version of the function \texttt{Normalizer} (\ref{Normalizer:for a perm group, semigroup, record}) but nowhere else in \textsf{Semigroups}. If \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} is not available, then \textsf{Semigroups} can be used as normal with the exception that this function will not work. 

 Some further details about semigroups in \textsf{GAP} and Green's relations in particular, can be found in  (\textbf{Reference: Semigroups}) and  (\textbf{Reference: Green's Relations}).

 If you find a bug or an issue with the package, then report this using the \href{http://bitbucket.org/james-d-mitchell/semigroups/issues} {issue tracker}. }

 
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Installing the \textsf{Semigroups} package}}\label{install}
\logpage{[ 1, 2, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7BA677207FAC28B3}{}
{
  In this section we give a brief description of how to start using \textsf{Semigroups}.

 It is assumed that you have a working copy of \textsf{GAP} with version number 4.7.3 or higher. The most up-to-date version of \textsf{GAP} and instructions on how to install it can be obtained from the main \textsf{GAP} webpage \href{http://www.gap-system.org} {\texttt{http://www.gap-system.org}}.

 The following is a summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of \textsf{Semigroups}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  ensure that the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html } {IO} package version 4.3 or higher is available. \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html } {IO} must be compiled before \textsf{Semigroups} can be loaded. 
\item  ensure that the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} package version 4.7 or higher is available. \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} and \textsf{Semigroups} both perform better if \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} is compiled. 
\item  \textsc{This step is optional:} certain functions in \textsf{Semigroups} require the \href{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/} {Grape} package to be available and fully compiled; a full list of these functions can
be found above. To use these functions make sure that the \href{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/} {Grape} package version 4.5 or higher is available. If \href{http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/} {Grape} is not fully installed (i.e. compiled), then \textsf{Semigroups} can be used as normal with the exception that the functions listed above will
not work. 
\item  \textsc{This step is optional:} the non-deterministic version of the function \texttt{Normalizer} (\ref{Normalizer:for a perm group, semigroup, record}) requires the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} package to be loaded. If you want to use this function, then please ensure
that the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} package version 1.5 or higher is available. 
\item  download the package archive \texttt{semigroups-2.0.tar.gz} from \href{http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php} {the Semigroups package webpage}. 
\item  unzip and untar the file, this should create a directory called \texttt{semigroups-2.0}.
\item  locate the \texttt{pkg} directory of your \textsf{GAP} directory, which contains the directories \texttt{lib}, \texttt{doc} and so on. Move the directory \texttt{semigroups-2.0} into the \texttt{pkg} directory. 
\item  start \textsf{GAP} in the usual way.
\item  type \texttt{LoadPackage("semigroups");}
\item  compile the documentation by using \texttt{SemigroupsMakeDoc} (\ref{SemigroupsMakeDoc}). 
\end{itemize}
  Presuming that the above steps can be completed successfully you will be
running the \textsf{Semigroups} package!

 If you want to check that the package is working correctly, you should run
some of the tests described in Section \ref{testing}.

 This function provides a method for writing transformations, partial
permutations, and bipartitions to a file, that uses a relatively small amount
of disk space. The resulting file can be further compressed using \texttt{gzip} or \texttt{xz}.

 The argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}} should be a list of elements, a semigroup, or a list of lists of elements, or
semigroups. The types of elements and semigroups supported are:
transformations, partial permutations, and bipartitions. 

 The argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}} should be a string containing the name of a file where the entries in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}} will be written or an \textsf{IO} package file object.

 If the optional third argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape append}} is given and equals \texttt{"w"}, then the previous content of the file is deleted. If the optional third
argument is \texttt{"a"} or is not present, then \texttt{list} is appended to the file. This function returns \texttt{true} if everything went well or \texttt{fail} if something went wrong.

 \texttt{WriteGenerators} appends a line to the file \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}} for every entry in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}}. If any element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}} is a semigroup, then the generators of that semigroup are written to \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}}. 

 The first character of the appended line indicates which type of element is
contained in that line, the second character \texttt{m} is the number of characters in the degree of the elements to be written, the
next \texttt{m} characters are the degree \texttt{n} of the elements to be written, and the internal representation of the elements
themselves are written in blocks of \texttt{m*n} in the remainder of the line. For example, the transformations: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  [ Transformation( [ 2, 6, 7, 2, 6, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5 ] ), 
    Transformation( [ 3, 8, 1, 9, 9, 4, 10, 5, 10, 6 ] )]
\end{Verbatim}
 are written as: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  t210 2 2 6 7 2 6 9 9 1 1 5 3 8 1 9 9 410 510 6

 The file \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}} can be read using \texttt{ReadGenerators} (\ref{ReadGenerators}). }

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}} is a string containing the name of a file created using \texttt{WriteGenerators} (\ref{WriteGenerators}), then \texttt{IteratorFromGeneratorsFile} returns an iterator \texttt{iter} such that \texttt{NextIterator(iter)} returns the next collection of generators stored in the file \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape filename}}. 

 This function is a convenient way of, for example, looping over a collection
of generators in a file without loading every object in the file into memory.
This might be useful if the file contains more information than there is
available memory. }

{
 In this chapter we describe the various ways that semigroups and monoids can
be created in \textsf{Semigroups}, the options that are available at the time of creation, and describe some
standard examples available in \textsf{Semigroups}. 

 Any semigroup created before \textsf{Semigroups} has been loaded must be recreated after \textsf{Semigroups} is loaded so that the options record (described in Section \ref{opts}) is defined. Almost all of the functions and methods provided by \textsf{Semigroups}, including those methods for existing \textsf{GAP} library functions, will return an error when applied to a semigroup created
before \textsf{Semigroups} is loaded.

\item \texttt{Semigroup} (\textbf{Reference: Semigroup}),

\item \texttt{ClosureInverseSemigroup} (\ref{ClosureInverseSemigroup}),
\item \texttt{ClosureSemigroup} (\ref{ClosureSemigroup}),
\item \texttt{SemigroupIdeal} (\ref{SemigroupIdeal})
\end{itemize}
 a record can be given as an optional final argument. The components of this
record specify the values of certain options for the semigroup being created.
A list of these options and their default values is given below. 

 Assume that \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is the semigroup created by one of the functions given above and that either: \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is generated by a collection \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape gens}} of transformations, partial permutations, Rees 0-matrix semigroup elements, or
bipartitions; or \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is an ideal of such a semigroup. 
\begin{description}
\item[{\texttt{acting}}]  this component should be \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}. In order for a semigroup to use the methods in \textsf{Semigroups} it must satisfy \texttt{IsActingSemigroup}. By default any semigroup or monoid of transformations, partial permutations,
Rees 0-matrix elements, or bipartitions satisfies \texttt{IsActingSemigroup}. From time to time, it might be preferable to use the exhaustive algorithm in
the \textsf{GAP} library to compute with a semigroup. If this is the case, then the value of
this component can be set \texttt{false} when the semigroup is created. Following this none of the methods in the \textsf{Semigroups} package will be used to compute anything about the semigroup. 
\item[{\texttt{regular}}]  this component should be \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}. If it is known \emph{a priori} that the semigroup \texttt{S} being created is a regular semigroup, then this component can be set to \texttt{true}. In this case, \texttt{S} knows it is a regular semigroup and can take advantage of the methods for
regular semigroups in \textsf{Semigroups}. It is usually much more efficient to compute with a regular semigroup that
to compute with a non-regular semigroup.

 If this option is set to \texttt{true} when the semigroup being defined is \textsc{not} regular, then the results might be unpredictable. 

 The default value for this option is \texttt{false}. 
\item[{\texttt{hashlen}}]  this component should be a positive integer, which roughly specifies the
lengths of the hash tables used internally by \textsf{Semigroups}. \textsf{Semigroups} uses hash tables in several fundamental methods. The lengths of these tables
are a compromise between performance and memory usage; larger tables provide
better performance for large computations but use more memory. Note that it is
unlikely that you will need to specify this option unless you find that \textsf{GAP} runs out of memory unexpectedly or that the performance of \textsf{Semigroups} is poorer than expected. If you find that \textsf{GAP} runs out of memory unexpectedly, or you plan to do a large number of
computations with relatively small semigroups (say with tens of thousands of
elements), then you might consider setting \texttt{hashlen} to be less than the default value of \texttt{25013} for each of these semigroups. If you find that the performance of \textsf{Semigroups} is unexpectedly poor, or you plan to do a computation with a very large
semigroup (say, more than 10 million elements), then you might consider
setting \texttt{hashlen} to be greater than the default value of \texttt{25013}. 

 You might find it useful to set the info level of the info class \texttt{InfoOrb} to 2 or higher since this will indicate when hash tables used by \textsf{Semigroups} are being grown; see \texttt{SetInfoLevel} (\textbf{Reference: SetInfoLevel}). 
\item[{\texttt{small}}] if this component is set to \texttt{true}, then \textsf{Semigroups} will compute a small subset of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape gens}} that generates \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} at the time that \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is created. This will increase the amount of time required to create \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} substantially, but may decrease the amount of time required for subsequent
calculations with \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. If this component is set to \texttt{false}, then \textsf{Semigroups} will return the semigroup generated by \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape gens}} without modifying \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape gens}}. The default value for this component is \texttt{false}.

 This option is ignored when passed to \texttt{ClosureSemigroup} (\ref{ClosureSemigroup}) or \texttt{ClosureInverseSemigroup} (\ref{ClosureInverseSemigroup}).

If you want to change the default values of these options for a single \textsf{GAP} session, then you can simply redefine the value in \textsf{GAP}. For example, to change the option \texttt{small} from the default value of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape false}} use: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@SemigroupsOptionsRec.small:=true;|
  true
\end{Verbatim}
 If you want to change the default values of the options stored in \texttt{SemigroupsOptionsRec} (\ref{SemigroupsOptionsRec}) for all \textsf{GAP} sessions, then you can edit these values in the file \texttt{semigroups/gap/options.g}.

{
 In this chapter we describe the various ways that an ideal of a semigroup can
be created and manipulated in \textsf{Semigroups}.

 We write \emph{ideal} to mean two-sided ideal everywhere in this chapter.

 The methods in the \textsf{Semigroups} package apply to any ideal of a transformation, partial permutation, or
bipartition semigroup, or an ideal of a subsemigroup of a Rees 0-matrix
semigroup, that is created by the function \texttt{SemigroupIdeal} (\ref{SemigroupIdeal}) or \texttt{SemigroupIdealByGenerators}. Anything that can be calculated for a semigroup defined by a generating set
can also be found for an ideal. This works particularly well for regular
ideals, since such an ideal can be represented using a similar data structure
to that used to represent a semigroup defined by a generating set but without
the necessity to find a generating set for the ideal. Many methods for
non-regular ideals rely on first finding a generating set for the ideal, which
can be costly (but not nearly as costly as an exhaustive enumeration of the
elements of the ideal). We plan to improve the functionality of \textsf{Semigroups} for non-regular ideals in the future.

The generators of an ideal of a semigroup.



 This function returns the generators of the two-sided ideal \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape I}}, which were used to defined \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape I}} when it was created. 

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape I}} is an ideal of a semigroup, then \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape I}} is defined to be the least 2-sided ideal of a semigroup \texttt{S} containing a set \texttt{J} of elements of \texttt{S}. The set \texttt{J} is said to \emph{generate} \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape I}}. 

 The notion of the generators of an ideal is distinct from the notion of the

the generators of an ideal is not, in general, equal to that ideal. Use \texttt{GeneratorsOfSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: GeneratorsOfSemigroup}) to obtain a semigroup generating set for an ideal, but beware that this can be

An ideal of a semigroup.



 The \texttt{Parent} (\textbf{Reference: Parent}) of an ideal is the semigroup in which the ideal was created, i.e. the first

 For a regular semigroup ideal, \texttt{SupersemigroupOfIdeal} will always be the top most semigroup used to create any of the predecessors
of the current ideal. For example, if \texttt{S} is a semigroup, \texttt{I} is a regular ideal of \texttt{S}, and \texttt{J} is an ideal of \texttt{I}, then \texttt{Parent(J)} is \texttt{I} and \texttt{SupersemigroupOfIdeal(J)} is \texttt{S}. This is to avoid computing a generating set for \texttt{I}, in this example, which is expensive and unnecessary since \texttt{I} is regular (in which case the Green's relations of \texttt{I} are just restrictions of the Green's relations on \texttt{S}). If \texttt{S} is a semigroup, \texttt{I} is a non-regular ideal of \texttt{S}, \texttt{J} is an ideal of \texttt{I}, then \texttt{SupersemigroupOfIdeal(J)} is \texttt{I}, since we currently have to use \texttt{GeneratorsOfSemigroup(I)} to compute anything about \texttt{I} other than its size and membership.

 \texttt{XClassOfYClass} returns the \texttt{X}-class containing the \texttt{Y}-class \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape class}} where \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} should be replaced by an appropriate choice of \texttt{D, H, L,} and \texttt{R}.

 Note that if it is not known to \textsf{GAP} whether or not the representative of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape class}} is an element of the semigroup containing \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape class}}, then no attempt is made to check this.

 The same result can be produced using: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  First(GreensXClasses(S), x-> Representative(x) in class);
\end{Verbatim}
 but this might be substantially slower. Note that \texttt{XClassOfYClass} is also likely to be faster than

 These functions produce essentially the same output as the \textsf{GAP} library functions with the same names; see \texttt{GreensDClassOfElement} (\textbf{Reference: GreensDClassOfElement}). The main difference is that these functions can be applied to a wider class
of objects: 
\begin{description}
\item[{\texttt{GreensDClassOfElement} and \texttt{DClass}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} must be a semigroup. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensHClassOfElement} and \texttt{HClass}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup, $\mathcal{R}$-class, $\mathcal{L}$-class, or $\mathcal{D}$-class.  If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape R}} is a \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape IxJ}} Rees matrix semigroup or a Rees 0-matrix semigroup, and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape i}} and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape j}} are integers of the corresponding index sets, then \texttt{GreensHClassOfElement} returns the $\mathcal{H}$-class in row \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape i}} and column \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape j}}. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensLClassOfElement} and \texttt{LClass}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup or $\mathcal{D}$-class. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensRClassOfElement} and \texttt{RClass}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup or $\mathcal{D}$-class. 
\end{description}
 Note that \texttt{GreensXClassOfElement} and \texttt{XClass} are synonyms and have identical output. The shorter command is provided for
the sake of convenience.

 These functions are essentially the same as \texttt{GreensDClassOfElement} (\ref{GreensDClassOfElement}) except that no effort is made to verify if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is an element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}}. More precisely, \texttt{GreensXClassOfElementNC} and \texttt{XClassNC} first check if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} has already been shown to be an element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}}. If it is not known to \textsf{GAP} if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is an element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}}, then no further attempt to verify this is made. 

 Note that \texttt{GreensXClassOfElementNC} and \texttt{XClassNC} are synonyms and have identical output. The shorter command is provided for
the sake of convenience. 

 It can be quicker to compute the class of an element using \texttt{GreensRClassOfElementNC}, say, than using \texttt{GreensRClassOfElement} if it is known \emph{a priori} that \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is an element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}}. On the other hand, if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is not an element of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}}, then the results of this computation are unpredictable.

 For example, if 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  f:=Transformation( [ 15, 18, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 ] );
\end{Verbatim}
 in the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} of order-preserving mappings on 20 points, then 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  GreensRClassOfElementNC(X, f);;
\end{Verbatim}
 returns an answer relatively quickly, whereas \texttt{GreensRClassOfElement} can take a signficant amount of time to return a value.

 These functions produce essentially the same output as the \textsf{GAP} library functions with the same names; see \texttt{GreensDClasses} (\textbf{Reference: GreensDClasses}). The main difference is that these functions can be applied to a wider class
of objects: 
\begin{description}
\item[{\texttt{GreensDClasses} and \texttt{DClasses}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} should be a semigroup. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensHClasses} and \texttt{HClasses}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup, $\mathcal{R}$-class, $\mathcal{L}$-class, or $\mathcal{D}$-class. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensLClasses} and \texttt{LClasses}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup or $\mathcal{D}$-class. 
\item[{\texttt{GreensRClasses} and \texttt{RClasses}}]  \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape X}} can be a semigroup or $\mathcal{D}$-class. 
\end{description}
 Note that \texttt{GreensXClasses} and \texttt{XClasses} are synonyms and have identical output. The shorter command is provided for
the sake of convenience.

\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
 An iterator. 



 Returns an iterator of the Green's classes in the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. See  (\textbf{Reference: Iterators}) for more information on iterators.

 This function is useful if you are, for example, looking for an $\mathcal{R}$-class of a semigroup with a particular property but do not necessarily want
to compute all of the $\mathcal{R}$-classes.

 See also \texttt{GreensRClasses} (\ref{GreensRClasses}), \texttt{GreensRClasses} (\textbf{Reference: GreensRClasses}), \texttt{NrRClasses} (\ref{NrRClasses}), and \texttt{IteratorOfRClassReps} (\ref{IteratorOfRClassReps}).

 The transformation semigroup in the example below has 25147892 elements but it
only takes a fraction of a second to find a non-trivial $\mathcal{R}$-class. The inverse semigroup of partial permutations in the example below has
size 158122047816 but it only takes a fraction of a second to find an $\mathcal{R}$-class with more than 1000 elements.

 \texttt{XClassReps} returns a list of the representatives of the Green's classes of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}}, which can be a semigroup, $\mathcal{D}$-, $\mathcal{L}$-, or $\mathcal{R}$-class where appropriate.

 The same output can be obtained by calling, for example: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  List(GreensXClasses(obj), Representative);
\end{Verbatim}
 Note that if the Green's classes themselves are not required, then \texttt{XClassReps} will return an answer more quickly than the above, since the Green's class
objects are not created.

 If the $\mathcal{D}$-class \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is a subsemigroup of a semigroup \texttt{S}, then the \emph{principal factor} of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is just \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} itself. If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is not a subsemigroup of \texttt{S}, then the principal factor of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is the semigroup with elements \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} and a new element \texttt{0} with multiplication of $x,y\in D$ defined by:  
\[ xy=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} x*y\ (\textrm{in }S)&\textrm{if }x*y\in D\\
0&\textrm{if }xy\not\in D. \end{array}\right. \]
   \texttt{InjectionPrincipalFactor} returns an injective function from the $\mathcal{D}$-class \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} to a Rees matrix semigroup, which contains the principal factor of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} as a subsemigroup. 

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is a subsemigroup of its parent semigroup, then the function returned by \texttt{InjectionPrincipalFactor} or \texttt{IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup} is an isomorphism from \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} to a Rees matrix semigroup; see \texttt{ReesMatrixSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: ReesMatrixSemigroup}).

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} is not a semigroup, then the function returned by \texttt{InjectionPrincipalFactor} is an injective function from \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}} to a Rees 0-matrix semigroup isomorphic to the principal factor of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape D}}; see \texttt{ReesZeroMatrixSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: ReesZeroMatrixSemigroup}). In this case, \texttt{IsomorphismReesMatrixSemigroup} returns an error.

 The generalized Schutzenberger group of the kernel \texttt{ker(f)} of a transformation \texttt{f} or the domain \texttt{dom(f)} of a partial permutation \texttt{f} is defined analogously. 

 The generalized Schutzenberger group of a Green's class is then defined as
follows. 
\begin{description}
\item[{$\mathcal{R}$-class}] The generalized Schutzenberger group of the image or range of the
representative of the $\mathcal{R}$-class. 
\item[{$\mathcal{L}$-class}] The generalized Schutzenberger group of the kernel or domain of the
representative of the $\mathcal{L}$-class. 
\item[{$\mathcal{H}$-class}] The intersection of the generalized Schutzenberger groups of the $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{L}$-class containing the $\mathcal{H}$-class. 
\item[{$\mathcal{D}$-class}] The intersection of the generalized Schutzenberger groups of the $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{L}$-class containing the representative of the $\mathcal{D}$-class.

The minimal $\mathcal{D}$-class of a semigroup.



 The minimal ideal of a semigroup is the least ideal with respect to

 It is significantly easier to find the minimal $\mathcal{D}$-class of a semigroup, than to find its $\mathcal{D}$-classes.

 \texttt{Generators} returns a generating set that can be used to define the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. The generators of a monoid or inverse semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}, say, can be defined in several ways, for example, including or excluding the
identity element, including or not the inverses of the generators. \texttt{Generators} uses the definition that returns the least number of generators. If no
generating set for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is known, then \texttt{GeneratorsOfSemigroup} is used by default.

The group of units of a semigroup.



 \texttt{GroupOfUnits} returns the group of units of the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} as a subsemigroup of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} if it exists and returns \texttt{fail} if it does not. Use \texttt{IsomorphismPermGroup} (\ref{IsomorphismPermGroup}) if you require a permutation representation of the group of units.

 If a semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} has an identity \texttt{e}, then the \emph{group of units} of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is the set of those \texttt{s} in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} such that there exists \texttt{t} in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} where \texttt{s*t=t*s=e}. Equivalently, the group of units is the $\mathcal{H}$-class of the identity of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}.

A list of idempotents.



 The argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} should be a semigroup, $\mathcal{D}$-class, $\mathcal{H}$-class, $\mathcal{L}$-class, or $\mathcal{R}$-class.

 If the optional second argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is present and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} is a semigroup, then a list of the idempotents in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} of rank \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is returned. If you are only interested in the idempotents of a given rank,
then the second version of the function will probably be faster. However, if
the optional second argument is present, then nothing is stored in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} and so every time the function is called the computation must be repeated.

 This functions produce essentially the same output as the \textsf{GAP} library function with the same name; see \texttt{Idempotents} (\textbf{Reference: Idempotents}). The main difference is that this function can be applied to a wider class of
objects as described above.

 Suppose that \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape R}} is a regular Rees (0-)matrix semigroup of the form $\mathcal{M}[G; I, J; P]$.  where \texttt{G} is a group and \texttt{P} is a \texttt{|J|} by \texttt{|I|} matrix with entries in \texttt{G} union \texttt{0}.

 The method used in this function is based on Remark 1 of \cite{Graham1968aa}.

\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
A small generating set for a semigroup.



 The attributes \texttt{SmallXGeneratingSet} return a relatively small generating subset of the collection of elements \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape coll}}, which can also be a semigroup. The returned value of \texttt{SmallXGeneratingSet}, where applicable, has the property that 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
        X(SmallXGeneratingSet(coll))=X(coll);
      
\end{Verbatim}
 where \texttt{X} is any of \texttt{Semigroup} (\textbf{Reference: Semigroup}), \texttt{Monoid} (\textbf{Reference: Monoid}), \texttt{InverseSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: InverseSemigroup}), or \texttt{InverseMonoid} (\textbf{Reference: InverseMonoid}).

 If the number of generators for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is already relatively small, then these functions will often return the
original generating set. These functions may return different results in
different \textsf{GAP} sessions.

 \texttt{SmallGeneratingSet} returns the smallest of the returned values of \texttt{SmallXGeneratingSet} which is applicable to \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape coll}}; see \texttt{Generators} (\ref{Generators}).

 As neither irredundancy, nor minimal length are proven, these functions
usually return an answer much more quickly than \texttt{IrredundantGeneratingSubset} (\ref{IrredundantGeneratingSubset}). These functions can be used whenever a small generating set is desired which
does not necessarily needs to be minimal.

A permutation group.



 In its first form, this function returns the normalizer of the transformation,
partial perm, or bipartition semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} in the permutation group \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}}. In its second form, the normalizer of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} in the symmetric group on \texttt{[1..n]} where \texttt{n} is the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is returned.

 The \textsc{normalizer} of a transformation semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} in a permutation group \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}} in the subgroup \texttt{H} of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}} consisting of those elements in \texttt{g} in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}} conjugating \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} to \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}, i.e. \texttt{\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}\texttt{\symbol{94}}g=\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}}. 

 Analogous definitions can be given for a partial perm and bipartition
semigroups.

 The method used by this operation is based on Section 3 in \cite{Araujo2010aa}.

 The optional final argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape opts}} allows you to specify various options, which determine how the normalizer is
calculated. The values of these options can dramatically change the time it
takes for this operation to complete. In different situations, different
options give the best performance. 

 The argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape opts}} should be a record, and the available options are: 
\begin{description}
\item[{random}]  If this option has the value \texttt{true} and the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} package is loaded, then the non-deterministic algorithms in \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} are used in \texttt{Normalizer}. So, there is some chance that \texttt{Normalizer} will return an incorrect result in this case, but these methods can also be
much faster than the deterministic algorithms which are used if this option is \texttt{false}. 

 If \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html } {genss} is not loaded, then this option is ignored. 

 The default value for this option is \texttt{false}. 
\item[{lambdastab}]  If this option has the value \texttt{true}, then \texttt{Normalizer} initially finds the setwise stabilizer of the images or right blocks of the
semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. Sometimes this improves the performance of \texttt{Normalizer} and sometimes it does not. If this option in \texttt{false}, then this setwise stabilizer is not found. 

 The default value for this option is \texttt{true}. 
\item[{rhostab}]  If this option has the value \texttt{true}, then \texttt{Normalizer} initially finds the setwise stabilizer of the kernels, domains, or left blocks
of the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. Sometimes this improves the performance of \texttt{Normalizer} and sometimes it does not. If this option is \texttt{false}, the this setwise stabilizer is not found. 

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is an inverse semigroup, then this option is ignored.

 The default value for this option is \texttt{true}.

 A semigroup is \emph{simple} if it has no proper 2-sided ideals. A semigroup is \emph{completely simple} if it is simple and possesses minimal left and right ideals. A finite
semigroup is simple if and only if it is completely simple. An inverse
semigroup is simple if and only if it is a group.

 As described in Section 5.9 of \cite{howie}, an inverse semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} with semilattice of idempotents \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape E}} is \emph{E-unitary} if for  
\[ s \in S\textrm{ and }e \in E\textrm{: }es \in E \Rightarrow s \in E. \]
  

 Equivalently, \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} is \emph{E-unitary} if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape E}} is closed in the natural partial order (see Proposition 5.9.1 in \cite{howie}):  
\[ \textrm{for } s \in S\textrm{ and }e \in E\textrm{: }e \le s \Rightarrow s \in
E. \]
  

 This condition is equivalent to \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape E}} being majorantly closed in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. See \texttt{IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigroup} (\ref{IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigroup}) and \texttt{IsMajorantlyClosed} (\ref{IsMajorantlyClosed}). Hence an inverse semigroup of partial permutations, block bijections or
partial permutation bipartitions is \emph{E-unitary} if and only if the idempotent semilattice is majorantly closed.

 An isomorphism to an inverse semigroup of partial permutations. 



 \texttt{VagnerPrestonRepresentation} returns an isomorphism from an inverse semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} where the elements of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} have a unique semigroup inverse accessible via \texttt{Inverse} (\textbf{Reference: Inverse}), to the inverse semigroup of partial permutations \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape T}} of degree equal to the size of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}, which is obtained using the Vagner-Preston Representation Theorem. 

 More precisely, if $f:S\to T$ is the isomorphism returned by \texttt{VagnerPrestonRepresentation(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}})} and $x$ is in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}, then $f(x)$ is the partial permutation with domain $Sx^{-1}$ and range $Sx^{-1}x$ defined by $f(x): sx^{-1}\mapsto sx^{-1}x$. 

 In many cases, it is possible to find a smaller degree representation than
that provided by \texttt{VagnerPrestonRepresentation} using \texttt{IsomorphismPartialPermSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: IsomorphismPartialPermSemigroup}) or \texttt{SmallerDegreePartialPermRepresentation} (\ref{SmallerDegreePartialPermRepresentation}). }

 The character table of the inverse semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} and a list of conjugacy class representatives of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. 



 Returns a list with two entries: the first entry being the character table of
the inverse semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} as a matrix, while the second entry is a list of conjugacy class
representatives of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. 

 The order of the columns in the character table matrix follows the order of
the conjugacy class representatives list. The conjugacy representatives are
grouped by $\mathcal{D}$-class and then sorted by rank. Also, as is typical of character tables, the
rows of the matrix correspond to the irreducible characters and the columns
correspond to the conjugacy classes.

{
 In this section, we describe some functions for creating pictures of various
structures related to a semigroup of transformations, partial permutations, or
bipartitions; or a subsemigroup of a Rees 0-matrix semigroup.

 Several of the functions described in this section return a string, which can
be written to a file using the function \texttt{FileString} (\textbf{GAPDoc: FileString}) or viewed using \texttt{Splash} (\ref{Splash}).

\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
Nothing.



 This function attempts to convert the string \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} into a pdf document and open this document, i.e. to splash it all over your
monitor.

 The string \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} must correspond to a valid \texttt{dot} or \texttt{LaTeX} text file and you must have have \texttt{GraphViz} and \texttt{pdflatex} installed on your computer. For details about these file formats, see \href{http://www.latex-project.org} {\texttt{http://www.latex-project.org}} and \href{http://www.graphviz.org} {\texttt{http://www.graphviz.org}}.

 This function is provided to allow convenient, immediate viewing of the
pictures produced by the functions: \texttt{TikzBlocks} (\ref{TikzBlocks}), \texttt{TikzBipartition} (\ref{TikzBipartition}), \texttt{DotSemilatticeOfIdempotents} (\ref{DotSemilatticeOfIdempotents}), and \texttt{DotDClasses} (\ref{DotDClasses}).

 The optional second argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape opts}} should be a record with components corresponding to various options, given
below. 
\begin{description}
\item[{path}]  this should be a string representing the path to the directory where you want \texttt{Splash} to do its work. The default value of this option is \texttt{"\texttt{\symbol{126}}/"}. 
\item[{directory}]  this should be a string representing the name of the directory in \texttt{path} where you want \texttt{Splash} to do its work. This function will create this directory if does not already
exist. 

 The default value of this option is \texttt{"tmp.viz"} if the option \texttt{path} is present, and the result of \texttt{DirectoryTemporary} (\textbf{Reference: DirectoryTemporary}) is used otherwise. 
\item[{filename}]  this should be a string representing the name of the file where \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} will be written. The default value of this option is \texttt{"vizpicture"}. 
\item[{viewer}]  this should be a string representing the name of the program which should open
the files produced by \texttt{GraphViz} or \texttt{pdflatex}. 
\item[{type}]  this option can be used to specify that the string \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} contains a {\LaTeX} or \texttt{dot} document. You can specify this option in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} directly by making the first line \texttt{"\%latex"} or \texttt{"//dot"}. There is no default value for this option, this option must be specified in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape str}} or in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape opt.type}}. 
\item[{filetype}]  this should be a string representing the type of file which \texttt{Splash} should produce. For {\LaTeX} files, this option is ignored and the default value \texttt{"pdf"} is used. 
\end{description}
 This function was written by Attila Egri-Nagy with some minor changes by J. D.
Mitchell.

 This function produces a graphical representation of the partial order of the $\mathcal{D}$-classes of the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}} together with the eggbox diagram of each $\mathcal{D}$-class. The output is in \texttt{dot} format (also known as \texttt{GraphViz}) format. For details about this file format, and information about how to
display or edit this format see \href{http://www.graphviz.org} {\texttt{http://www.graphviz.org}}. 

 The string returned by \texttt{DotDClasses} can be written to a file using the command \texttt{FileString} (\textbf{GAPDoc: FileString}).

 The $\mathcal{D}$-classes are shown as eggbox diagrams with $\mathcal{L}$-classes as rows and $\mathcal{R}$-classes as columns; group $\mathcal{H}$-classes are shaded gray and contain an asterisk. The $\mathcal{D}$-classes are numbered according to their index in \texttt{GreensDClasses(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}})}, so that an \texttt{i} appears next to the eggbox diagram of \texttt{GreensDClasses(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}})[i]}. A red line from one $\mathcal{D}$-class to another indicates that the higher $\mathcal{D}$-class is greater than the lower one in the $\mathcal{D}$-order on \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. 

 If the optional second argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape record}} is present, it can be used to specify some options for output. 
\begin{description}
\item[{number}]  if \texttt{\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape record}}.number} is \texttt{false}, then the $\mathcal{D}$-classes in the diagram are not numbered according to their index in the list
of $\mathcal{D}$-classes of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. The default value for this option is \texttt{true}. 
\item[{maximal}]  if \texttt{\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape record}}.maximal} is \texttt{true}, then the structure description of the group $\mathcal{H}$-classes is displayed; see \texttt{StructureDescription} (\textbf{Reference: StructureDescription}). Setting this attribute to \texttt{true} can adversely affect the performance of \texttt{DotDClasses}. The default value for this option is \texttt{false}.

\chapter{\textcolor{Chapter }{ Bipartitions and blocks }}\label{bipartition}
\logpage{[ 5, 0, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7C18DB427C9C0917}{}
{
  In this chapter we describe the functions in \textsf{Semigroups} for creating and manipulating bipartitions and semigroups of bipartitions. We
begin by describing what these objects are. 

 A \emph{partition} of a set $X$ is a set of pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets of $X$ whose union is $X$. 

 Let $n\in$$\mathbb{N}$, let $\mathbf{n}$$=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, and let $-$$\mathbf{n}$$=\{-1,-2,\ldots,-n\}$. 

 The \emph{partition monoid} of degree $n$ is the set of all partitions of $\mathbf{n}$$\cup$-$\mathbf{n}$ with a multiplication we describe below. To avoid conflict with other uses of
the word "partition" in \textsf{GAP}, and to reflect their definition, we have opted to refer to the elements of
the partition monoid as \emph{bipartitions} of degree $n$; we will do so from this point on. 

 Let $x$ be any bipartition of degree $n$. Then $x$ is a set of pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets of $\mathbf{n}$$\cup$-$\mathbf{n}$ whose union is $\mathbf{n}$$\cup$-$\mathbf{n}$; these subsets are called the \emph{blocks} of $x$. A block containing elements of both $\mathbf{n}$ and -$\mathbf{n}$ is called a \emph{transverse block}. If $i$,$j$$\in$$\mathbf{n}$$\cup$-$\mathbf{n}$ belong to the same block of a bipartition $x$, then we write ($i$,$j$)$\in$$x$. 

   Let $x$ and $y$ be bipartitions of equal degree. Then $x$$y$ is the bipartition where $i$,$j$$\in$$\mathbf{n}$$\cup$-$\mathbf{n}$ belong to the same block of $x$$y$ if there exist $k(1), k(2),\ldots, k(r)\in \mathbf{n}$ ; and one of the following holds: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $r$$=0$ and either $($$i$,$j$$)\in$$x$ or $($-$i$,-$j$$)\in$$y$; 
\item   $r=2s-1$ for some $s\geq 1$ and 
\[(i,-k(1))\in x,\ (k(1),k(2))\in y,\ (-k(2),-k(3))\in x,\ \ldots,\
(-k(2s-2),-k(2s-1))\in x,\ (k(2s-1),-j)\in y\]
   
\item   $r=2s$ for some $s\geq 1$ and either: 
\[(i,-k(1))\in x,\ (k(1),k(2))\in y,\ (-k(2),-k(3))\in x,\ \ldots, (k(2s-1),
k(2s))\in y,\ (-k(2s), j)\in x\]
 or 
\[(-i,k(1))\in y,\ (-k(1),-k(2))\in x,\ (k(2),k(3))\in y,\ \ldots, (-k(2s-1),
-k(2s))\in x,\ (k(2s), -j)\in y.\]
   
\end{itemize}
 This product can be shown to be associative, and so the collection of
bipartitions of any particular degree is a monoid; the identity element is the
partition $\left\{\{i,-i\}:i\in\mathbf{n}\right\}$.  A bipartition is a unit if and only if each block is of the form $\{$$i$,-$j$$\}$ for some $i$, $j$$\in$$\mathbf{n}$. Hence the group of units is isomorphic to the symmetric group on $\mathbf{n}$. 

 Let $x$ be a bipartition of degree $n$. Then we define $x$$^*$ to be the bipartition obtained from $x$ by replacing $i$ by -$i$ and -$i$ by -$i$ in every block of $x$ for all $i$$\in$$\mathbf{n}$. It is routine to verify that if $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary bipartitions of equal degree, then  
\[ (x^*)^*=x,\quad xx^*x=x,\quad x^*xx^*=x^*,\quad (xy)^*=y^*x^*. \]
   In this way, the partition monoid is a \emph{regular *-semigroup}.

  There are several ways of creating bipartitions in \textsf{GAP}, which are described in this section.

 \texttt{Bipartition} returns the bipartition \texttt{f} with equivalence classes \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape blocks}}, which should be a list of duplicate-free lists whose union is \texttt{[-n..-1]} union \texttt{[1..n]} for some positive integer \texttt{n}. 

 \texttt{Bipartition} returns an error if the argument does not define a bipartition. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@f:=Bipartition( [ [ 1, -1 ],[ 2, 3, -3 ], [ -2 ] ] );|

}\hfill{\scriptsize (operation)}}\\
\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
A bipartition.



 It is possible to create a bipartition using its internal representation. The
argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}} must be a list of positive integers not greater than \texttt{n}, of length \texttt{2*n}, and where \texttt{i} appears in the list only if \texttt{i-1} occurs earlier in the list. 

 For example, the internal representation of the bipartition with blocks 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  [ 1, -1 ], [ 2, 3, -2 ], [ -3 ]
\end{Verbatim}
 has internal representation 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  [ 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3 ]
\end{Verbatim}
 The internal representation indicates that the number \texttt{1} is in class \texttt{1}, the number \texttt{2} is in class \texttt{2}, the number \texttt{3} is in class \texttt{2}, the number \texttt{-1} is in class \texttt{1}, the number \texttt{-2} is in class \texttt{2}, and \texttt{-3} is in class \texttt{3}. As another example, \texttt{[ 1, 3, 2, 1 ]} is not the internal representation of any bipartition since there is no \texttt{2} before the \texttt{3} in the second position.

 In its first form \texttt{BipartitionByIntRep} verifies that the argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape list}} is the internal representation of a bipartition. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@BipartitionByIntRep([ 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4 ]);                         |

{
  It is possible that a bipartition can be represented as another type of
object, or that another type of \textsf{GAP} object can be represented as a bipartition. In this section, we describe the
functions in the \textsf{Semigroups} package for changing the representation of bipartition, or for changing the
representation of another type of object to that of a bipartition.

 The operations \texttt{AsPermutation} (\ref{AsPermutation:for a bipartition}), \texttt{AsPartialPerm} (\ref{AsPartialPerm:for a bipartition}), \texttt{AsTransformation} (\ref{AsTransformation:for a bipartition}) can be used to convert bipartitions into permutations, partial permutations,
or transformations where appropriate.

\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
A bipartition.



 \texttt{AsBipartition} returns the bipartition, permutation, transformation, or partial permutation \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}, as a bipartition of degree \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}. There are several possible arguments for \texttt{AsBipartition}: 
\begin{description}
\item[{permutations}]  If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a permutation and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is a positive integer, then \texttt{AsBipartition(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}, \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}})} returns the bipartition on \texttt{[1..\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}]} with classes \texttt{[i, i\texttt{\symbol{94}}\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}]} for all \texttt{i=1..n}.

 If no positive integer \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is specified, then the largest moved point of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is used as the value for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}; see \texttt{LargestMovedPoint} (\textbf{Reference: LargestMovedPoint (for a permutation)}). 
\item[{transformations}]  If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a transformation and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is a positive integer such that \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a transformation of \texttt{[1..\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}]}, then \texttt{AsTransformation} returns the bipartition with classes $(i)f^{-1}\cup \{i\}$ for all \texttt{i} in the image of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}.

 If the positive integer \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is not specified, then the internal degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is used as the value for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}. 
\item[{partial permutations}]  If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a partial permutation \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is a positive integer, then \texttt{AsBipartition} returns the bipartition with classes \texttt{[i, i\texttt{\symbol{94}}\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}]} for \texttt{i} in \texttt{[1..\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}]}. Thus the degree of the returned bipartition is the maximum of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} and the values \texttt{i\texttt{\symbol{94}}\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}} where \texttt{i} in \texttt{[1..\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}]}.

 If the optional argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is not present, then the default value of the maximum of the largest moved
point and the largest image of a moved point of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} plus \texttt{1} is used. 
\item[{bipartitions}]  If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a bipartition and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is a non-negative integer, then \texttt{AsBipartition} returns a bipartition corresponding to \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} with degree \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}}. 

 If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} equals the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}, then \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is returned. If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is less than the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}, then this function returns the bipartition obtained from \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} by removing the values exceeding \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} or less than \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape -n}} from the blocks of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}. If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape n}} is greater than the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}, then this function returns the bipartition with the same blocks as \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} and the singleton blocks \texttt{i} and \texttt{-i} for all \texttt{i} greater than the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}

 The degree of a bipartition is, roughly speaking, the number of points where
it is defined. More precisely, if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is a bipartition defined on \texttt{2*n} points, then the degree of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}} is \texttt{n}. 

 The degree of a collection \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape coll}} of bipartitions of equal degree is just the degree of any (and every)
bipartition in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape coll}}. The degree of collection of bipartitions of unequal degrees is not defined.

 The right blocks of bipartition are \textsf{GAP} objects in their own right, and are not simply a list of blocks of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape f}}; see \ref{section-blocks} for more information. 

 The significance of this notion lies in the fact that bipartitions \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are $\mathcal{L}$-related in the partition monoid if and only if they have equal right blocks.

  As described above the left and right blocks of a bipartition characterise
Green's $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{L}$-relation on the partition monoid; see \texttt{LeftBlocks} (\ref{LeftBlocks}) and \texttt{RightBlocks} (\ref{RightBlocks}). The left or right blocks of a bipartition are \textsf{GAP} objects in their own right.

bipartition.

 This function makes it possible to create a \textsf{GAP} object corresponding to the left or right blocks of a bipartition without
reference to any bipartitions. 

 \texttt{BlocksNC} returns the blocks with equivalence classes \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape classes}}, which should be a list of duplicate-free lists consisting solely of positive
or negative integers, where the union of the absolute values of the lists is \texttt{[1..n]} for some \texttt{n}. The blocks with positive entries correspond to transverse blocks and the
classes with negative entries correspond to non-transverse blocks.

 A \emph{bipartition semigroup} is simply a semigroup consisting of bipartitions. An object \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} is a bipartition semigroup in \textsf{GAP} if it satisfies \texttt{IsSemigroup} (\textbf{Reference: IsSemigroup}) and \texttt{IsBipartitionCollection} (\ref{IsBipartitionCollection}).

 A \emph{bipartition monoid} is a monoid consisting of bipartitions. An object \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape obj}} is a bipartition monoid in \textsf{GAP} if it satisfies \texttt{IsMonoid} (\textbf{Reference: IsMonoid}) and \texttt{IsBipartitionCollection} (\ref{IsBipartitionCollection}).

 Note that it is possible for a bipartition semigroup to have a multiplicative
neutral element (i.e. an identity element) but not to satisfy \texttt{IsBipartitionMonoid}. For example, 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]

 In this example \texttt{S} cannot be converted into a monoid using \texttt{AsMonoid} (\textbf{Reference: AsMonoid}) since the \texttt{One} (\textbf{Reference: One}) of any element in \texttt{S} differs from the multiplicative neutral element.

\logpage{[ 6, 0, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7E51292C8755DCF2}{}
{
  This chapter describes the functions in \textsf{Semigroups} for dealing with free inverse semigroups. This part of the manual and the
functions described herein were written by Julius Jonu{\v s}as.

 A \emph{free inverse semigroup} is an inverse semigroup having the following universal property. An inverse
semigroup $F$ is a \emph{free inverse semigroup} on a non-empty set $X$ if $F$ is an inverse semigroup with a map $f$ from $F$ to $X$ such that for every inverse semigroup $S$ and a map $g$ from $X$ to $S$ there exists a unique morphism $g'$ from $F$ to $S$ such that $fg' = g$. This object is unique up to isomorphism. Moreover, by the universal
property, every inverse semigroup can be expressed as a quotient of a free
inverse semigroup.

 The internal representation of an element of a free inverse semigroup uses a
Munn tree. A \emph{Munn tree} is a directed tree with distinguished start and terminal vertices and where
the edges are labeled by generators so that two edges labeled by the same
generator are only incident to the same vertex if one of the edges is coming
in and the other is leaving the vertex. For more information regarding free
inverse semigroups and the Munn representations see Section 5.10 of \cite{howie}. See also  (\textbf{Reference: Inverse semigroups and monoids}),  (\textbf{Reference: Partial permutations}) and  (\textbf{Reference: Free Groups, Monoids and Semigroups}).

 An element of a free inverse semigroup in \textsf{Semigroups} is displayed, by default, as a shortest word corresponding to the element.
However, there might be more than one word of the minimum length. For example,
if $x$ and $y$ are generators of a free inverse semigroups, then 
\[xyy^{-1}xx^{-1}x^{-1} = xxx^{-1}yy^{-1}x^{-1};\]
 see \texttt{MinimalWord} (\ref{MinimalWord:for free inverse semigroup element}). Therefore we provide a another method for printing elements of a free
inverse semigroup: a unique canonical form. Suppose an element of a free
inverse semigroup is given as a Munn tree. Let $L$ be the set of words corresponding to the shortest paths from the start vertex
to the leaves of the tree. Also let $w$ be a word corresponding to the shortest path from start to terminal vertices.
The word $vv^{-1}$ is an idempotent for every $v$ in $L$. The canonical form is given by multiplying these idempotents, in shortlex
order, and then postmultiplying by $w$. For example, consider the word $xyy^{-1}xx^{-1}x^{-1}$ again. The words corresponding to the paths to the leaves are in this case $xx$ and $xy$. And $w$ is an empty word since start and terminal vertices are the same. Therefore,
the canonical form is 
\[xxx^{-1}x^{-1}xyy^{-1}x^{-1}.\]
 See \texttt{CanonicalForm} (\ref{CanonicalForm:for a free inverse semigroup element}).

\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Congruence on Rees matrix semigroups}}\logpage{[ 7, 2, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7C6255437BA13690}{}
{
  This section describes the implementation of congruences of 0-simple
semigroups in the \textsf{Semigroups} package, and the functions associated with them. This code and this part of
the manual were written by Michael Torpey. Most of the theorems used in this
chapter are from Section 3.5 of \cite{howie}.

 By the Rees Theorem, any 0-simple semigroup $S$ is isomorphic to a \emph{Rees 0-matrix semigroup} (see  (\textbf{Reference: Rees Matrix Semigroups})) over a group, with a regular sandwich matrix.  That is, 
\[S \cong \mathcal{M}^0[G; I,\Lambda; P], \]
 where $G$ is a group, $\Lambda$ and $I$ are non-empty sets, and $P$ is regular in the sense that it has no rows or columns consisting soley of
zeroes.  

 The congruences of a Rees 0-matrix semigroup are in 1-1 correspondence with
the \emph{linked triple}, which is a triple of the form \texttt{[N,S,T]} where: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{N} is a normal subgroup of the underlying group \texttt{G}, 
\item  \texttt{S} is an equivalence relation on the columns of \texttt{P}, 
\item  \texttt{T} is an equivalence relation on the rows of \texttt{P}, 
\end{itemize}
 satisfying the following conditions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  a pair of \texttt{S}-related columns must contain zeroes in precisely the same rows, 
\item  a pair of \texttt{T}-related rows must contain zeroes in precisely the same columns, 
\item  if \texttt{i} and \texttt{j} are \texttt{S}-related, \texttt{k} and \texttt{l} are \texttt{T}-related and the matrix entries $p_{k, i}, p_{k, j}, p_{l, i}, p_{l, j} \neq 0$, then $q_{k, l, i, j} \in N$, where 
\[q_{k, l, i, j} = p_{k, i} p_{l, i}^{-1} p_{l, j} p_{k, j}^{-1}.\]
 
\end{itemize}
 By Theorem 3.5.9 in \cite{howie}, for any finite 0-simple Rees 0-matrix semigroup, there is a bijection
between its non-universal congruences and its linked triples. In this way, we
can internally represent any congruence of such a semigroup by storing its
associated linked triple instead of a set of generating pairs, and thus
perform many calculations on it more efficiently.

 If a congruence is defined by a linked triple \texttt{(N,S,T)}, then a single class of that congruence can be defined by a triple \texttt{(Nx,i/S,k/S)}, where \texttt{Nx} is a right coset of \texttt{N}, \texttt{i/S} is the equivalence class of \texttt{i} in \texttt{S}, and \texttt{k/S} is the equivalence class of \texttt{k} in \texttt{T}. Thus we can internally represent any class of such a congruence as a triple
simply consisting of a right coset and two positive integers.

  The linked triples of a completely 0-simple Rees 0-matrix semigroup describe
only its non-universal congruences. In any one of these, the zero element of
the semigroup is related only to itself. However, for any semigroup $S$ the universal relation $S \times S$ is a congruence; called the \emph{universal congruence}. The universal congruence on a semigroup has its own unique representation.

 Since many things we want to calculate about congruences are trivial in the
case of the universal congruence, this package contains a category
specifically designed for it, \texttt{IsUniversalSemigroupCongruence}. We also define \texttt{IsUniversalSemigroupCongruenceClass}, which represents the single congruence class of the universal congruence.

The lex-least multiplication table of a semigroup.



 This function returns the lex-least multiplication table of a semigroup
isomorphic to the semigroup \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape S}}. \texttt{SmallestMultiplicationTable} is an isomorphism invariant of semigroups, and so it can, for example, be used
to check if two semigroups are isomorphic. 

 Due to the high complexity of computing the smallest multiplication table of a
semigroup, this function only performs well for semigroups with at most
approximately 50 elements.

 \texttt{SmallestMultiplicationTable} is based on the function \texttt{IdSmallSemigroup} (\textbf{Smallsemi: IdSmallSemigroup}) by Andreas Distler.

 The functions described in this section supplement the \href{ http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html } {Orb} package by providing methods for finding something in an orbit, with the

A positive integer or \texttt{fail}.



 This function returns the position of the value \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape val}} in the orbit \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}}. If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}} is closed, then this is equivalent to doing \texttt{Position(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}}, \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape val}})}. However, if \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}} is open, then the orbit is enumerated until \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape val}} is found, in which case the position of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape val}} is returned, or the enumeration ends, in which case \texttt{fail} is returned. 

 If the optional argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape onlynew}} is present, it should be \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}. If \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape onlynew}} is \texttt{true}, then \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape val}} will only be checked against new points in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}}. Otherwise, every point in the \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}}, not only the new ones, is considered. }

In the former case, the position of the first point
in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape o}} for which \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape func}} returns \texttt{true} is returned, and in the latter \texttt{false} is returned.

A word in the generators.



 \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape orb}} must be an orbit object with a Schreier tree and orbit graph, that is, the
options \texttt{schreier} and \texttt{orbitgraph} must have been set to \texttt{true} during the creation of the orbit, \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape m}} must be the number of a strongly connected component of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape orb}}, and \texttt{nr} must be the number of a point in the \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape m}}th strongly connect component of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape orb}}. 

 This operation traces the result of \texttt{SchreierTreeOfSCC} (\ref{SchreierTreeOfSCC}) and with arguments \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape orb}} and \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape m}} and returns a word in the generators that maps the first point in the \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape m}}th strongly connected component of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape orb}} to the point with number \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape nr}}. Here, a word is a list of integers, where positive integers are numbers of
generators. See also \texttt{OrbSCC} (\ref{OrbSCC}), \texttt{ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC} (\ref{ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC}), \texttt{SchreierTreeOfSCC} (\ref{SchreierTreeOfSCC}), and \texttt{TraceSchreierTreeOfSCCBack} (\ref{TraceSchreierTreeOfSCCBack}).
