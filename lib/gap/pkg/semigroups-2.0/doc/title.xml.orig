  <Abstract>
    The &Semigroups; package is a &GAP; package containing methods for
    semigroups, principally semigroups of 
     of transformations and partial permutations. &Semigroups; contains more
     efficient methods than those available in the GAP library (and in many
     cases more efficient than any other software) for creating semigroups of
     transformations and partial permutations, calculating their
     Green's classes, size, elements, group of units, minimal ideal,
     small generating sets, testing membership, finding the inverses of
     a regular element, factorizing elements over the generators, and
     many more. It is also possible to test if a semigroup satisfies a
     particular property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse,
     completely regular, and a variety of further properties. Several
     catalogues of examples are provided, such as generators for the
     endomorphism monoids of every connected graph with at most 8 vertices,
     and generators of the endomorphism monoids of the non-abelian groups with
     order at most 64.<P/>

     There are functions to define and manipulate free inverse semigroups and
     their elements.
