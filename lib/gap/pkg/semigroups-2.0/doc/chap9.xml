<Chapter Label="Homomorphisms"><Heading>Homomorphisms</Heading> 

  In this chapter we describe the various ways to define a homomorphism from a
  semigroup to another semigroup. <P/>

  Support for homomorphisms in &Semigroups; is currently rather limited but
  there are plans to improve this in the future.
