\Chapter{Parametrised Presentations}

In this chapter we describe which pp-presentations for infinite
coclass sequences (see \cite{ELG08}) are provided. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Provided pp-presentations}

\>`ParPresGlobalVar_2_1' V
\>`ParPresGlobalVar_2_2' V
\>`ParPresGlobalVar_3_1' V

are lists consisting of the pp-presentations of the infinite 
coclass sequences of finite <p>-groups of coclass <r>, where the first number
in the name gives the underlying prime and the second the underlying coclass. 
Each entry in the list is a record 
<rec>( <rel>, <expo>, <n>, <d>, <m>, <prime>, <cc>, <expo_vec>, <name> )
with <m> = 0 and <expo_vec> = [ ]. The record entries are of a form such that 
each record can be used as input for 
%display{tex}
{\tt PPPPcpGroups},
%enddisplay
"PPPPcpGroups". See "PPPPcpGroups" for more information.

\>`ParPresGlobalVar_p_r_Names' V 

gives the names of the infinite coclass sequences of finite <p>-groups of
coclass <r>.
