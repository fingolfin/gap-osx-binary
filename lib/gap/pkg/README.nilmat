                             The Nilmat package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Nilmat".

This package contains methods for checking whether a given matrix group
is nilpotent and for computing with nilpotent matrix groups. The considered
matrix groups may be matrix groups over a finite field or the field of
rational numbers.

The Nilmat package is written in GAP code only and does not use
external binaries. To install the package, you only need to move
it into the directory pkg of your GAP installation. To load the
package, you only need to start GAP and type

  LoadPackage("nilmat");

The ``Nilmat" package banner should appear on the screen.

For details on  how  to  use  the  Nilmat  package  see  the
package documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (view either
`manual.dvi'  via `xdvi' or `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).
Before using the package, please pay attention to the bugfix
information in Chapter 4 of the manual.
