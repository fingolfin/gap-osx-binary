<p>
The Coset Table Window will initially show you a coset table with
columns for each of the generators of the presently investigated group
<var>g</var> and their inverses, in which only the consequences of giving the
subgroup <var>h</var> the coset number  1 are inserted (so that at the
beginning it has only one row). We have already described in Chapter
<a href="CHAP004.htm">The Tables</a> how to work interactively by mouse clicks in this table.
<p>
Also in that chapter (see Sections&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT002">Warnings</a> and <a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT003">The Information Line</a>) we have described the warnings that may appear directly below
the Coset Table and the ``Information Line'' that is placed further
below the coset table.
<p>
However the Coset Table Window also provides via buttons and menus
access to much of the functionality offered by ITC.
<p>
The Coset Table Window has a row of four buttons at the top: <code>Sheet</code>,
<code>Settings</code>, <code>Close</code>, and <code>File</code>. We will refer to these as the <strong>top
buttons</strong>. Clicking one of these will pop up a menu from which you can
select actions in the course of a coset enumeration. You do this by
holding the left mouse button while moving the pointer to the
respective entry in the menu and releasing the mouse button there.
Then the respective action of the program will be executed while the
menu vanishes.
<p>
This action may consist in popping up yet another (query) window into
which you have to write further (e.&nbsp;g. numerical) instructions or in
setting modes for the CE or in immediately performing certain changes
in the coset table and other tables.
<p>
This way of selecting actions may be felt to be uncomfortable and
hence for convenience the most frequently used actions occurring
during a coset enumeration can be prompted more directly by clicking
one of 18 buttons provided at the bottom of the Coset Table Window.
We will refer to these as the <strong>bottom buttons</strong>.
<p>
In the section ``The Top Buttons'' (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SECT001">The Top Buttons</a>) we will describe
the menus belonging to the buttons at the top of the coset table.
<p>
In a further section ``The Bottom Buttons'' (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SECT002">The Bottom Buttons</a>) we
will describe the use of the bottom buttons.
<p>
Many of the windows to be described will contain two further buttons
<code>ok</code> and <code>cancel</code>. Clicking <code>ok</code> means that you want the order
executed that is described in the window while <code>cancel</code> means that you
do not want this execution. In any case, having pressed one of this
buttons, you will afterwards return to where you called this window
from.
<p>
Note that <strong>buttons</strong> are in general clicked with the <strong>left</strong> mouse
button.
<p>
There is one exception where clicking a bottom button with the
<strong>right</strong> mouse button will have an effect namely with showing the
definitions made. This is explained in the description of the effect
of the bottom button <code>show defs</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.12">show defs</a>).
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT001">5.1 The Top Buttons</a></h2>
<p><p>
<strong>Button</strong> <code>Sheet</code>
<p>
Note: <strong>This button also appears as a top button in each of the
``display windows''</strong>.
<p>
Display windows (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) are opened by
clicking the following bottom buttons of the Coset Table Window:
<code>show rels</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.10">show rels</a>), <code>show subgrp</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.11">show subgrp</a>),
<code>show defs</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.12">show defs</a>), <code>show gaps</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.13">show gaps</a>), and
<code>show coincs</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.14">show coincs</a>), as well as in the display window
opened by clicking the menu entry <code>show current settings</code> in the
menu popped up via the top button <code>Settings</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.8">show current settings</a>).
<p>
The menu popped up by the button <code>Sheet</code> has only two entries:
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.1"></a>
<dt><li><code>save as postscript <dd></code>
  This allows you to save the contents of the respective window (e.&nbsp;g.
  the Coset Table Window) as a PostScript file. Releasing the left
  mouse button on this entry will pop up a further menu which allows you
  to enter the name of the file to which you want this to be written.
  You are assisted doing this by a list of names of files that exist in
  your directories, and from which you can choose. The menu also offers
  you three more buttons: <code>ok</code>, <code>cancel</code>, and <code>home</code>. Choosing <code>home</code>
  will insert the name of your home directory into the provided field
  while <code>ok</code> starts the action after you have finished the name of the
  target file, and <code>cancel</code> brings you back to the window in which you
  clicked the button <code>Sheet</code>.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.2"></a>
<dt><li><code>close graphic sheet <dd></code>
  This closes the display window and brings you back to the window from
  which you had opened it.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Button</strong> <code>Settings</code>
<p>
The menu popped up by this button has ten entries. Two of these allow
one to influence the size of the table provided for the coset
enumeration. Seven further ones allow one to turn on or off certain
modes to be followed during the enumeration. These modes can be
turned on or off at the beginning, but can also be changed later on
during the enumeration. The last menu entry allows one to open a window
in which the presently set parameters and modes are shown.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.3"></a>
<dt><li><code>change default table size <dd></code>
  This opens a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) in which
  you can change the default table size from the original value of
  1000 to any positive integer you want by typing the desired size
  into a field provided for this purpose, but consider that
  unnecessarily high values may cause garbage collections. Clicking
  <code>ok</code> means that you accept the value now given in the field and return
  to the Coset Table Window, clicking <code>cancel</code> brings you back there
  without having changed the existing default table size. You can
  change your decision by going to that window again. Note that
  changing the default value while a CE is under the way does not change
  the present table size. If you want to or have to change the table
  size during a coset enumeration, you can use the next menu entry
  <code>extend table size</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.4">extend table size</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.4"></a>
<dt><li><code>extend table size <dd></code>
  The text in the query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) tells
  you the present table size and proposes twice that size as the value
  to which it should be changed. You can again alter that value. <code>ok</code>
  and <code>cancel</code> have the same meaning as before.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
Note that an analogous window for extending the table size will spring
up if in the coset enumeration you have exhausted the preset table
size. If you extend the table size and leave by clicking <code>ok</code> the CE
will immediately be resumed with the extended table size being
provided. If you do not extend the table size in such a case, ITC
will refuse to accept or make further definitions. If you then extend
the table size using <code>extend table size</code> as described in <a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.4">extend table size</a> the calculation can be resumed but must be restarted again.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<a name = "SSEC001.5"></a>
<dt><li><code>coincidence handling off</code>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.5"></a>
<dt><li><code>coincidence handling on <dd></code>
  ITC allows one to follow stepwise the handling of coincidences if such
  occur. Since however this can be a fairly slow procedure that one
  might not want to follow in detail, this feature can be turned on and
  off by these two menu entries. If coincidence handling is switched
  off any process will automatically come to a halt as soon as a
  coincidence is encountered. At that time a window with the list of
  pending coincidences will spring up and can then be used to eliminate
  coincidences one by one in any wanted sequence ``by hand'' (see <a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT010">The   List of Pending coincidences</a>). Also in the coset table (in addition
  to the last definition made) all rows get marked in red that are up
  for elimination. Note that while coincidences are pending the same
  coset number can occur more than once in a column of an ITC Coset
  Table. By default coincidence handling will be switched on if you
  start with a new group from the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> window, however if you make a
  new attempt with the same group having finished the last one by the
  <code>clear</code> button (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.16">clear</a>) you will retain the previous choice.
<p>
<a name = "SSEC001.6"></a>
<dt><li><code>echo on</code>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.6"></a>
<dt><li><code>echo off <dd></code>
  When you use a mouse click to perform any of the operations of ITC
  this will be documented by a line of the form <code>gap&gt;
  PointerButtonDown( <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,...)</code> or <code>gap&gt; MenuSelected( <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>,...)</code>
  in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> window, where e.&nbsp;g. the integers  <i>x</i>,  <i>y</i>, ... specify
  the position in the window in which you have clicked. This,
  however, does not help you easily to understand what you have done. It
  is not even helpful for re-doing what you have done, because in a
  repeat the windows may sit in different places. On the other hand in
  a long interactive run you may want to be able to reconstruct your
  actions, be it -- horribile dictu -- that you have run into a bug that
  you want to report, or - rather better - that by a stroke of luck you
  found the result in a particularly nice and short way. For this
  purpose you can click the menu entry <code>echo on</code>. Having done this
  the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> window will after each of these rather ununderstandable
  messages print with the prefix <code>&gt;&gt;</code> readable information on the button
  or menu entry, respectively, that you had clicked, in many cases
  simply the text written in that button or menu entry. Since you can
  write in parallel everything occurring in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> window to a file
  using the <code>LogTo</code> command (see&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/htm/ref/CHAP009.htm#SSEC007.5">LogTo</a> in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> reference
  manual) you can thus keep a record of your interactive actions. If
  you do not want this feature, you can switch it off again.
<p>
<a name = "SSEC001.7"></a>
<dt><li><code>gaps strategy 1 (first gap)</code>
<a name = "SSEC001.7"></a>
<dt><li><code>gaps strategy 2 (first rep of max weight)</code>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.7"></a>
<dt><li><code>gaps strategy 3 (last rep of max weight) <dd></code>
  These strategies have been explained in Section <a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some definition   Strategies</a>. You have the option to <strong>preset the strategy</strong> of
  selecting the next gap of length 1 using these menu entries. Then
  they can be executed using the bottom button <code>fill gaps</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.6">fill   gaps</a>). In the query window opened by clicking this bottom button
  you can prescribe <strong>how many</strong> ``fill gaps'' steps you want to make
  following the preset strategy. By default strategy 1 will be chosen.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.8"></a>
<dt><li><code>show current settings <dd></code>
  Selecting this menu entry opens a display window in which the chosen
  default table size and the current table size as well as the choices
  of modes (<code>coincidence handling on/off</code> and <code>echo on/off</code>) and of the
  strategy for choosing the next gap of length 1 are shown. As long as
  this window remains open it will be updated whenever any of these
  values is changed.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Button</strong> <code>Close</code>
<p>
The menu popped up by this button allows one to choose various strategies
for trying to finish the coset enumeration. The present menu entries
are
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<a name = "SSEC001.9"></a>
<dt><li><code>close table by Felsch</code>
<a name = "SSEC001.9"></a>
<dt><li><code>use gaps strategy 1 (first gap)</code>
<a name = "SSEC001.9"></a>
<dt><li><code>use gaps strategy 2 (first rep of max weight)</code>
<a name = "SSEC001.9"></a>
<dt><li><code>use gaps strategy 3 (last rep of max weight)</code>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.9"></a>
<dt><li><code>close table by HLT <dd></code>
  All these have been described in principle in Section <a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition   Strategies</a>. Note however that the ``closing gaps of length 1''
  strategies automatically use Felsch steps if and as long as no gap of
  length 1 exists at a certain stage. If you want to see exactly how
  this happens you have to use the <code>fill gaps</code> command (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.6">fill gaps</a>)
  with some high number of wanted steps and to help it with Felsch steps
  thrown in interactively if it gets stuck because of lack of gaps of
  length 1. We will demonstrate this in the first of the examples.
  Note that all but the first strategy do not guarantee the Mendelsohn
  Condition.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Button</strong> <code>File</code>
<p>
The menu popped up by this button has three entries which concern
reading from and writing to files important information that may have
been obtained by a longer interactive coset enumeration:
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.10"></a>
<dt><li><code>read definitions from file <dd></code>
  indexdefinition!read from file
  Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) in which you can write the name of the
  file. You are assisted in doing that by a list of names of files that
  exist in your directories, from which you can choose. Note that this
  choice is disabled (and the menu text <code>read definitions from file</code>
  coloured grey instead of black) as soon as you have started a coset
  enumeration so that reading in another definiton sequence does not
  make sense any longer.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.11"></a>
<dt><li><code>write definitions to file <dd></code>
  indexdefinition!write to file
  order to possibly reuse it, you can write this definition sequence to
  a file. Releasing the mouse button at this entry opens a query window
  (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) in which you can write the name of
  the file. Again you are assisted by being offered some filenames from
  which you can choose. Note that a definition sequence can be written
  to a file at any time during a CE, so that you can use it to proceed
  in different ways from a certain state that you have reached. However
  note that this menu entry is disabled (and the menu text <code>write
  definition to file</code> coloured grey instead of black) as long as no
  definition sequence exists yet.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC001.12"></a>
<dt><li><code>write standardized table to file <dd></code>
  As mentioned e.&nbsp;g. also in Section <a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT003">the Information Line</a> there is no
  renumbering of coset numbers in case some of them are eliminated by
  the handling of coincidences. That means that at the end of a coset
  enumeration that did involve handling of coincidences the coset
  numbers will form a sequence of natural numbers that starts with  1
  but has ``holes''. This is inconvenient, in particular if one wants to
  consider the columns of the coset table as the permutations of the
  cosets under right multiplication by the respective generator (or
  inverse generator). Therefore after a CE has finished it is possible
  to write a standardized coset table (in which in particular the coset
  numbers now run from  1 to the index of <var>h</var> in <var>g</var>) to a file, which
  then can be processed in any wanted way by <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. Releasing the mouse
  button at this entry will open a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does   it work?</a>) in which you can write the name of this file. Again you are
  assisted by being offered file names from which you may choose. Note
  that this menu entry is disabled and the text <code>write standardized
  table to file</code> coloured grey instead of black as long as the tables
  have not closed. That is, only closed coset tables can be
  standardized by ITC.
  A coset table that has been written this way to a file with name
  <var>filename</var> can be read into <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> and assigned to a variable <var>costab</var>
  via
<dt><br><code></code><var>costab</var><code>:= ReadAsFunction( </code><var>filename</var><code> )();</code>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT002">5.2 The Bottom Buttons</a></h2>
<p><p>
The different kind of functionality of these 18 buttons is
to some extent indicated by their colours.
<p>
The first two (blue) buttons just allow one to scroll to the lines of
the coset table that one wants to work with, if it contains more than
30 ``alive'' rows.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.1"></a>
<dt><li><code>scroll to <dd></code>
  Upon clicking this button a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it   work?</a>) will be opened in which you can specify <strong>by its number</strong> the
  row in the Coset Table that you want to see. The Coset Table will be
  scrolled up or down in such a way that the wanted row appears in the
  middle of the displayed part of the Coset Table. As a default, the
  number of the last still alive row of the Coset Table will be offered
  to you. If the specified coset number is no longer ``alive'' the
  maximal alive coset number below the specified one is taken instead.
  Any displayed Relation Tables or the Table of Definitions will be
  scrolled in parallel to the Coset Table.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.2"></a>
<dt><li><code>scroll by <dd></code>
  Upon clicking this button a query window (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it   work?</a>) will be opened in which you can enter into a field provided
  for the purpose the number of rows by which you want to scroll up or
  down in the coset table. Positive integers mean scrolling up, that is
  to higher coset numbers, negative integers mean scrolling down, that
  is to lower coset numbers. Originally the value 20 (that you may
  change) is offered in this field. If you click this button a second
  time, the number that you had accepted last time will be offered
  again, thus allowing you to glance through the Coset Table at certain
  intervals without having to type in a new number each time, Note that
  here <strong>actual rows shown in the tables</strong> are counted. That is, if some
  rows have been suppressed by coincidence handling they are not
  counted, so that you may end up with rows of higher numbers than you
  expected. Any displayed Relation Tables or the Table of Definitions
  will be scrolled in parallel to the Coset Table.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
The next seven (green) buttons all give access to certain strategies
to be followed through several steps in a coset enumeration. See
Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition Strategies</a> for details.
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.3"></a>
<dt><li><code>Felsch <dd></code>
  The ``Felsch'' strategy for performing a coset enumeration makes a
  sequence of definitions by row-wise filling empty places in the coset
  table and by searching for all consequences after each definition
  which are then immediately worked in as well as all coincidences that
  may be found. Upon clicking this button a query window (see Section
  <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) will be opened, in which you can choose how many
  definitions you want to have made following this strategy. As default
  (that you can change) the number 1 is offered; choosing this is
  hence tantamount to making a definition in the first empty place in
  the coset table in a row-wise scan.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.4"></a>
<dt><li><code>HLT <dd></code>
  The ``HLT'' strategy proceeds by filling rows of Subgroup and Relation
  Tables (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition Strategies</a> and note in
  particular that as explained there the HLT strategy of ITC deviates
  in some respect from what is usually meant by the term). Upon
  clicking this button a query window (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>)
  is opened in which you can specify how many definitions you want to
  make using this strategy. If you want to <strong>close</strong> the tables using a
  HLT strategy, you can use the menu entry <code>close table by HLT</code> (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.9">close   table by HLT</a>) in the menu opened by the top button <code>Close</code>.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.5"></a>
<dt><li><code>fill rows <dd></code>
  This button allows you to fill at once in all Relation and Subgroup
  Tables all rows that belong to one or more prescribed coset numbers.
  Upon clicking this button a query window (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it   work?</a>) will be opened in which you can specify the wanted coset
  numbers, separated by commas. As a default the smallest number  <i>i</i> is
  offered for which not all  <i>i</i>th rows of Relation and Subgroup Tables
  are filled yet. Note that you can only fill rows that do exist, that
  is rows of a coset number that has already been defined and has not
  been eliminated by coincidence handling. If you violate this
  condition, your order will be ignored. If you want to fill a row only
  in a particular Subgroup or Relation Table or in the Coset Table you
  can do this by clicking at the beginning of the respective row
  (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT001">The Coset Table</a> and <a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT005">The Relation Tables</a>). Specifying the
  (non-existing) coset number 0 allows you to fill just the (first and
  only) rows of the Subgroup Tables without filling rows in any of the
  Relation Tables.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.6"></a>
<dt><li><code>fill gaps <dd></code>
  Closing rows in relation or subgroup tables in which only one place is
  open, is the easiest way to get immediate consequences. Such empty
  places are called <strong>gaps of length&nbsp;1</strong>. Often several choices of such
  ``gaps of length 1'' to be closed are possible and ITC offers
  various strategies to make this choice (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition   Strategies</a>). (Remember -- compare Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition   Strategies</a> -- : by inspecting the Relation Tables that you can
  display by ITC you may not see all these gaps of length 1, since
  ITC does not display all the relation tables that can be obtained
  by cyclic permutation of the relators in the given presentation.)
  These strategies can be set via the top button <code>Settings</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.7">gaps   strategy 1</a>); by default strategy 1 will have been set. Clicking
  the button <code>fill gaps</code> will open a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does   it work?</a>), in which you can specify how many times you want to close
  a gap of length 1 that is chosen by the selected strategy. By
  clicking the button <code>show gaps</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.13">show gaps</a>) you can learn which
  gaps of length 1 are open at a given time. However note that by
  closing a particular gap of length 1 often new gaps of length 1
  will be created, so that by entering a number, say  <i>ng</i>, bigger than
  the number of presently existing gaps of length 1 into this window
  you will start off what might be called a ``pure minimal gap strategy''.
  This is often a very good strategy, however by the theory about the
  Todd-Coxeter method it is not guaranteed that such a ``pure minimal gap
  strategy'' must terminate, even if the index of <var>h</var> in <var>g</var> is finite
  since the so called Mendelsohn Condition might be violated (see
  <a href="biblio.htm#Neu82"><cite>Neu82</cite></a>). If you click this button while no gaps of length 1
  exist, a warning <code>There are no gaps of length 1</code> will appear in red
  below the coset table. If the process runs out of gaps of length 1
  before  <i>ng</i> of such gaps have been closed, the process will stop and a
  warning <code>There are no more gaps of length 1</code> will appear in red below
  the Coset Table. Note that the strategies for <strong>closing</strong> the tables by
  filling gaps of length 1 that are offered in the menu of the top
  button <code>Close</code> are not ``pure minimal gap strategies'', they throw in
  Felsch type definitions if no gaps of length 1 exist (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.9">use gaps   strategy 1</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.7"></a>
<dt><li><code>back to <dd></code>
  In experimenting with various definition sequences you may want to
  retrace to a certain point in your procedure. This is offered by this
  button. Upon clicking it a query window (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it   work?</a>) is opened that allows you to retrace <strong>to the situation after
  defining the coset number that you enter into a given field</strong>. The
  default offered is to retrace by just one step by offering the
  last-but-one defined coset number. If you enter a <strong>negative</strong> integer,
  the CE process is retraced <strong>by</strong> a number of definitions that is the
  absolute value of the negative integer that you had entered.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.8"></a>
<dt><li><code>sort defs <dd></code>
  indexdefinition!sorting
  Definitions'' method (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT004">Sorting Definitions</a>) to the Coset
  Table. Note that this button is disabled if the tables have not
  closed. You may sometimes observe during the running of this method
  that the number <code>Defined</code> in the Information Line is decreasing. When
  the method has come to an end this will be indicated in the

<dt><li><code>short-cut <dd></code>
  As already pointed out in Section <a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT005">The Short-cut Method</a>, the number of
  coincidences encountered before all tables close may strongly depend
  on the definition sequence (the strategy followed). Once closure has
  been reached, the definition sequence that has led to the result is
  kept, and in case coincidences have occurred one may try to use it for
  finding a shorter definition sequence that also leads to the result.
  An algorithm that tries to do this has been developed by Volkmar
  Felsch. This ``Short-cut'' method is described in Section <a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT005">The   Short-cut Method</a>, here we just mention that it goes through various
  cycles that each may reduce the number of still needed definitions.
  By clicking the button <code>short-cut</code> a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How   does it work?</a>) is opened in which you can specify the number of
  cycles of the Short-cut method to be performed or can decide to let it
  run until it terminates having exhausted all its (finitely many)
  possibilities. This stepwise reduction can be observed in the
  Information Line (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT003">The Information Line</a>) where the number of
  defined cosets keeps changing, and the number of cycles of the method
  performed so far is displayed, until the algorithm stops. While the
  reduction achieved is often quite remarkable it should be understood
  that no guarantee is given that the absolute minimum of needed
  definitions will be found. In fact by experimenting with this feature
  you can see that the final number of definitions after this ``pruning''
  can depend on the sequence of definitions from which you start. Note
  that you can inspect the definition sequence before and after this
  pruning using the bottom button <code>show defs</code> (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.12">show defs</a>). Note that
  the Short-cut method can only be applied after tables have <strong>closed</strong>,
  if you try to invoke it before this has been achieved, a warning <code>The
  tables have not closed</code> flashes up in red below the Coset Table and
  nothing happens.

</dl>
<p>
Of the six white buttons five allow you to open further ``display''
windows (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>), in which additional
information about the state of the coset enumeration is shown. Note
that clicking the same button a second time will close the
corresponding display window.

<dt><a name = "SSEC002.10"></a>
<dt><li><code>show rels <dd></code>
  Clicking this button opens a window that shows the ``List of Relators''
  (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT004">The List of relators</a> for operating this). Note that thus it
  indirectly gives access to the Relation Tables (see Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT005">The   Relation Tables</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.11"></a>
<dt><li><code>show subgrp <dd></code>
  Clicking this button opens a window that shows the List of Subgroup
  Generators (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT006">The List of Subgroup Generators</a> for operating this).
  Note that it thus indirectly gives access to the Subgroup Tables
  (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT007">The Subgroup Tables</a>). If no subgroup generators are given, that
  is if you try to enumerate the cosets of the trivial subgroup, no window
  is opened but the warning <code>There are no subgroup generators</code> flashes
  up in red below the Coset Table.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.12"></a>
<dt><li><code>show defs <dd></code>
  indexdefinition!show
  shows the Table of Definitions (see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT008">The Table of Definitions</a>).
  Clicking with the <strong>right</strong> mouse button will instead colour in the
  Coset Table all those entries green in which the respective coset
  number was defined in the present definition sequence. We hope that
  seeing the distribution of the definitions in the coset table may be
  of interest in particular if such a definition sequence has been
  obtained by use of the Short-cut method (see <a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC002.9">short-cut</a> and <a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT005">The   Short-cut Method</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.13"></a>
<dt><li><code>show gaps <dd></code>
  Clicking this button opens a window showing a list of
  ``representatives'' of the equivalence classes of presently known gaps
  of length 1. See Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT002">Some Definition Strategies</a> and
  Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT009">The List of Length 1 Gaps</a> for a description of the structure
  and meaning of that list as well as for the operations that can be
  started by clicking in that list. If no gaps of length 1 exist, no
  window will be opened, but a warning <code>There are no gaps of length 1</code>
  will flash up in red below the Coset table.
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.14"></a>
<dt><li><code>show coincs <dd></code>
  If no coincidences are pending upon clicking this button the warning
  <code>There are no pending coincidences</code> will flash up in red below the
  Coset Table. Otherwise clicking this bottom button opens a window
  which displays the text <code>Pending coincidences</code> and a list of these.
  See <code>The List of Pending Coincidences</code> (Section <a href="CHAP004.htm#SECT010">The List of Pending   Coincidences</a>) for a description of the structure and meaning of that
  list and the operations that can be started by clicking in that list.

The white button
<p>
<p>
<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.15"></a>
<dt><li><code>mark cosets <dd></code>
  allows one to mark certain cosets (in green colour) in all tables in
  order to see easily where they occur. Clicking this bottom button
  opens a query window (see Section <a href="CHAP001.htm#SECT004">How does it work?</a>) in which you
  can enter the coset numbers (separated by commas) that you want to get
  coloured. Entering an empty sequence of coset numbers to be marked
  will erase any markings.

There are finally three red buttons, which allow you to leave your
present calculation with ITC in various ways.

<dl compact>
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.16"></a>
<dt><li><code>clear <dd></code>
  Clicking this bottom button will clear all the tables from all
  entries constructed in the coset enumeration, while keeping the group
  and subgroup that you had entered into <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, so that you can directly
  start anew with the same problem. The table size will be reset to the
  default table size, but otherwise settings defined during the last
  run, for instance whether coincidence handling is switched on or off,
  will remain, that is, not automatically be set to their default
  values. Remember that you can inspect the present settings in the
  window opened via the menu entry <code>show current settings</code> (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.8">show   current settings</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.17"></a>
<dt><li><code>reset <dd></code>
  This works similarly to <code>clear</code> except that all settings will be reset
  to their default values. Remember again that you can inspect the
  present settings in the window opened via the menu entry <code>show current
  settings</code> (<a href="CHAP005.htm#SSEC001.8">show current settings</a>).
<p>
<dt><a name = "SSEC002.18"></a>
<dt><li><code>quit <dd></code>
  This closes all windows and just brings you back to the GAP
  window. In a new start of ITC all switches will be set to their
  default values. The group that you had handled will still be available
  as a <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> object.
