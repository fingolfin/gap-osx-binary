  [33X[0;0YThis package provides an interface between [5XGAP[105X 4 and the Australian National
  University  Nilpotent  Quotient Program (ANU NQ). The ANU NQ was implemented
  as  part  of  the  author's  work towards his PhD at the Australian National
  University,  hence  the  name  of  the program. The program takes as input a
  finite  presentation  of  a  group  and  successively computes factor groups
  modulo  the  terms  of  the  lower central series of the group. These factor
  groups are computed in terms of polycyclic presentations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  ANU NQ is implemented in the programming language C. The implementation
  has  been  developed  in  a  Unix environment and Unix is currently the only
  operating  system supported. It runs on a number of different Unix versions,
  e.g. Solaris and Linux.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  integer  matrix  computations it relies on the GNU MP [GMP] package and
  requires this package to be installed on your system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  relies on the functionality for polycyclic groups provided by
  the  [5XGAP[105X package [5Xpolycyclic[105X [EN02] and requires the package [5Xpolycyclic[105X to be
  installed as a [5XGAP[105X package on your computer system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YComments,  bug  reports and suggestions are very welcome, please submit them
  via our issue tracker ([7Xhttps://github.com/gap-system/nq/issues[107X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  manual  contains references to parts of the [5XGAP[105X Reference Manual which
  are typeset in a slightly idiosyncratic way. The following example shows how
  such  references  are  printed:  'For further information on creating a free
  group see [2XFreeGroup[102X ([14XReference: FreeGroup[114X).' The text in bold face refers to
  the [5XGAP[105X Reference Manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach item in the list of references at the end of this manual is followed by
  a  list  of numbers that specify the pages of the manual where the reference
  occurs.[133X
