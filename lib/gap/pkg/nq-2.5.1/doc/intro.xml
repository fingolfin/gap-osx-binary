This package provides an interface between &GAP; 4 and the
Australian National University Nilpotent Quotient Program (ANU NQ).
The ANU NQ was implemented as part of the author's work towards his
PhD at the Australian National University, hence the name of the
program.  The program takes as input a finite presentation of a
group and successively computes factor groups modulo the terms of
the lower central series of the group.  These factor groups are
computed in terms of polycyclic presentations.

<P/> The ANU NQ is implemented  in  the programming language  C. The
implementation has been developed in  a Unix environment and Unix is
currently the only operating system  supported.  It runs on a number
of different Unix versions, e.g.  Solaris and Linux.

<P/> For integer matrix computations it relies on the GNU MP <Cite
Key="GNUMP"/> package and requires this package to be installed on
your system.

<P/> This package relies  on the functionality for polycyclic groups
provided  by the  &GAP; package  <Package>polycyclic</Package> <Cite
Key="polycyclic"/>       and        requires       the       package
<Package>polycyclic</Package> to be installed  as a &GAP; package on
your computer system.

<P/>
Comments,  bug reports and  suggestions are  very welcome, please
submit them via our

<P/> This manual contains references to parts of the &GAP; Reference
Manual which are typeset in a slightly idiosyncratic way.  The
following example shows how such references are printed: 'For
further information on creating a free group see <Ref BookName="ref"
Func="FreeGroup"/>.'  The text in bold face refers to the &GAP;
Reference Manual.

<P/>Each item in the list of references at the end of this manual is
followed by a list of numbers that specify the pages of the manual
where the reference occurs.
