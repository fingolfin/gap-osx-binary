  [33X[0;0YOver time, the interface of [5XPolycyclic[105X has changed. This was done to get the
  names  of  [5XPolycyclic[105X functions to agree with the general naming conventions
  used   throughout   GAP.   Also,   some   [5XPolycyclic[105X  operations  duplicated
  functionality  that  was  already  available  in  the  core  of  GAP under a
  different  name.  In  these  cases,  whenever  possible  we  now install the
  [5XPolycyclic[105X  code  as  methods  for  the  existing  GAP operations instead of
  introducing new operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  backward  compatibility,  we  still  provide the old, obsolete names as
  aliases.  However,  please  consider  switching  to the new names as soon as
  possible.  The  old  names  may  be  completely removed at some point in the
  future.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe following function names were changed.[133X
