<h2>Description</h2>
This package provides algorithms for working with polycyclic groups.

The features of this package include
<ul>        
<li> creating a polycyclic group from a polycyclic presentation 
<li> arithmetic in a polycyclic group
<li> computation with subgroups and factor groups of a polycyclic group
<li> computation of standard subgroup series such as the derived 
     series, the lower central series
<li> computation of the first and second cohomology 
<li> computation of group extensions
<li> computation of normalizers and centralizers
<li> solutions to the conjugacy problems for elements and subgroups
<li> computation of Torsion and various finite subgroups
<li> computation of various subgroups of finite index
<li> computation of the Schur multiplicator, non-abelian the exterior square and the non-abelian tensor square

</ul>

<h2>(Bug) reports</h2>

<p>If you use <span class="pkg">Polycyclic</span>, we would like to know.
 A short email to one of us would be nice. 

<p>Any comments about the package are very welcome.  If you have found
important features missing or if there is a bug, let us know and we
will try to address it as soon as possible.

<h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
  In order to install and use <span class="pkg">Polycyclic</span>,
  your also need to install both <span class="pkg">Alnuth</span> and
  <span class="pkg">AutPGrp</span>. The former contains  
  methods for algebraic number theory, the later for computations of
  automorphisms of p-groups; both are required by Polycyclic for
  various operations.

  The <a href="README">README</a> file describes the installation
  of the <span class="pkg">Polycyclic</span> package. 
  </p>

  <p>For the installation of Alnuth and AutPGrp, follow the instructions in their
  respective manuals.
  </p>


  <h2>Online Documentation</h2>

  <!-- links to the documentation, maybe in several formats -->
  <p>
  The manual of <span class="pkg">Polycyclic</span> is available as
       <a href="polycyclic-manual.pdf">PDF</a> and
       <a href="doc/chap0_mj.html">HTML</a>.

  <p>
  If the package has been installed properly, the manual is
  also accessible through the GAP online help.
