  <Abstract>
    The &Semigroups; package is a &GAP; package containing methods for
    semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroups, principally of
    transformations, partial permutations, bipartitions, subsemigroups of
    regular Rees 0-matrix semigroups, and the free inverse semigroup. 
    <P/>
    
    &Semigroups; contains more efficient methods than those available in the
    &GAP; library (and in many cases more efficient than any other software) for
    creating semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroup, calculating their
    Green's structure, ideals, size, elements, group of units, small generating
    sets, testing membership, finding the inverses of a regular element,
    factorizing elements over the generators, and many more. It is also possible
    to test if a semigroup satisfies a particular property, such as if it is
    regular, simple, inverse, completely regular, and a variety of further
    properties.
    <P/>
    
    There are methods for finding congruences of certain types of semigroups,
    the normalizer of a semigroup in a permutation group, the maximal
    subsemigroups of a finite semigroup, and smaller degree partial permutation
    representations and the character tables of inverse semigroups. There are
    functions for producing pictures of the Green's structure of a semigroup,
    and for drawing bipartitions.
