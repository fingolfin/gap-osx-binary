  This chapter describes the functions in &Semigroups; for dealing with free
  inverse semigroups and free bands. This part of the manual and the functions
  described herein were written by Julius Jonu&#353;as.<P/>
  
  <Section Label = "sect:Free inverse semigroups">
  <Heading> Free inverse semigroups </Heading>
  <M>F</M> is a <E>free inverse semigroup</E> on a non-empty set <M>X</M> if
  <M>F</M> is an inverse semigroup with a map <M>f</M> from <M>F</M> to <M>X</M>
  such that for every inverse semigroup <M>S</M> and a map <M>g</M> from
  <M>X</M> to <M>S</M> there exists a unique homomorphism <M>g'</M> from
  <M>F</M> to <M>S</M> such that <M>fg' = g</M>. Moreover, by the universal
  property, every inverse semigroup can be expressed as a quotient of a free
  inverse semigroup.<P/>

  The internal representation of an element of a free inverse semigroup
  uses a Munn tree. A <E>Munn tree</E> is a directed tree with distinguished
  start and terminal vertices and where the edges are labeled by generators so
  that two edges labeled by the same generator are only incident to the same
  vertex if one of the edges is coming in and the other is leaving the vertex.
  For more information regarding free inverse semigroups and the Munn
  representations see Section 5.10 of <Cite Key = "howie"/>.
 
  See also <Ref Chap = "Inverse semigroups and monoids" BookName = "ref"/>,
  <Ref Chap = "Partial permutations" BookName = "ref"/> and <Ref Sect = "Free
    Groups, Monoids and Semigroups" BookName = "ref" />.<P/> 

  An element of a free inverse semigroup in &Semigroups; is be displayed, by
  default, as a shortest word corresponding to the element. 
  However, there might
  be more than one word of the minimum length. For example, if <M>x</M>
  and <M>y</M> are generators of a free inverse semigroups, then 
  <Display>xyy^{-1}xx^{-1}x^{-1} = xxx^{-1}yy^{-1}x^{-1}.</Display>
  See <Ref Oper="MinimalWord" Label = "for free inverse semigroup element"/> 
  Therefore we provide a another method for printing elements of a free
  inverse semigroup: a unique canonical form.
  Suppose an element of a free inverse semigroup is given as a Munn tree. Let 
  <M>L</M> be the set of words corresponding to the shortest paths from
  the start vertex to the leaves of the tree. Also let <M>w</M>
  be a word corresponding to the shortest path from start to terminal
  vertices. The word <M>vv^{-1}</M> is an idempotent for every <M>v</M> in
  <M>L</M>.  The canonical form is given by multiplying these 
  idempotents, in shortlex order, and then postmultiplying by <M>w</M>.
  For example, consider the word <M>xyy^{-1}xx^{-1}x^{-1}</M> again. 
  The words corresponding to the paths to the leaves are in this case 
  <M>xx</M> and <M>xy</M>. And <M>w</M> is an empty word since start and 
  terminal vertices are the same. Therefore, the canonical form is 
  <Display>xxx^{-1}x^{-1}xyy^{-1}x^{-1}.</Display>
  See <Ref Oper = "CanonicalForm" Label = "for a free inverse semigroup element"/>.

  <Heading> Displaying free inverse semigroup elements </Heading>
  There is a way to change how &GAP; displays free inverse semigroup
  elements using the user preference <C>FreeInverseSemigroupElementDisplay</C>.
  See <Ref Func = "UserPreference" BookName = "ref"/> for more information
  about user preferences.<P/>

  There are two possible values for <C>FreeInverseSemigroupElementDisplay</C>:
  <List>
    <Mark>minimal </Mark>
    <Item> With this option selected, &GAP; will display a shortest word
      corresponding to the free inverse semigroup element. However, 
      this shortest word is not unique. This is a default setting.
    </Item>

    <Mark>canonical</Mark>
    <Item> With this option selected, &GAP; will display a free inverse 
      semigroup element in the canonical form.
    </Item>
  </List>

<Example><![CDATA[
gap> SetUserPreference("semigroups", "FreeInverseSemigroupElementDisplay", "minimal");
gap> S:=FreeInverseSemigroup(2);
<free inverse semigroup on the generators [ x1, x2 ]>
gap> S.1 * S.2;

  <Heading> Free bands </Heading>
  A semigroup <M>B</M> is a <E>free band</E> on a non-empty set <M>X</M> if
  <M>B</M> is a band with a map <M> f </M> from <M> B </M> to <M>X</M> such that
  for every band <M> S </M> and every map <M> g </M> from <M>X</M> to <M> B </M>
  there exists a unique homomorphism <M> g'</M> from <M>B</M> to <M>S</M> such
  that <M>fg' = g</M>. The free band on a set <M>X</M> is unique up to
  isomorphism.  Moreover, by the universal property, every band can be expressed
  as a quotient of a free band.<P/>

  For an alternative description of a free band. Suppose that <M> X </M> is a
  non-empty set and <M> X^+ </M> a free semigroup on <M> X </M>. Also suppose
  that <M> b </M> is the smallest congurance on <M> X^+ </M> containing the set
  <Display> \{ (w^2, w) : w \in X^+ \}. </Display> Then the free band on 
  <M> X </M> is isomorphic to the quotient of <M> X^+ </M> by <M> b </M>.
  See Section 4.5 of <Cite Key = "howie" /> for more information on free bands.
