<Heading>Introduction</Heading>

&HomalgToCAS; is one of the core packages of the &homalg; project
<Cite Key="homalg-project"/>. But as one of the rather technical
packages, this manual is probably not of interest for the average
uers. The average user will usually not get in direct contact with the
operations provided by this package. <P/>

Quoting from the Appendix <Ref Appendix="The Core Packages"
BookName="homalg"/> of the &homalg; package manual (&see;
<Ref Sect="HomalgToCAS" BookName="homalg"/>): <P/>

<Quoted>The package &HomalgToCAS; (which needs the &homalg; package)
includes all what is needed to let the black boxes used by &homalg;
reside in external computer algebra systems. So as mentioned above,
&HomalgToCAS; is the right place to declare the three &GAP;
representations external rings, external ring elements, and external
matrices. Still, &HomalgToCAS; is independent from the external
computer algebra system with which &GAP; will communicate <E>and</E>
independent of how this communication physically looks like.</Quoted>
