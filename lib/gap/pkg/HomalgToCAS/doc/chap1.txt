  [33X[0;0Y[5XHomalgToCAS[105X  is  one of the core packages of the [5Xhomalg[105X project [hpa10]. But
  as  one  of  the  rather  technical packages, this manual is probably not of
  interest  for  the  average  uers.  The average user will usually not get in
  direct contact with the operations provided by this package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YQuoting  from  the  Appendix  [14X'homalg: The Core Packages and the Idea behind
  their Splitting'[114X of the [5Xhomalg[105X package manual (--> [14X'homalg: HomalgToCAS'[114X):[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[21XThe  package  [5XHomalgToCAS[105X (which needs the [5Xhomalg[105X package) includes all what
  is  needed to let the black boxes used by [5Xhomalg[105X reside in external computer
  algebra  systems.  So  as mentioned above, [5XHomalgToCAS[105X is the right place to
  declare   the  three  [5XGAP[105X  representations  external  rings,  external  ring
  elements,  and external matrices. Still, [5XHomalgToCAS[105X is independent from the
  external  computer  algebra  system  with  which  [5XGAP[105X  will  communicate [13Xand[113X
  independent of how this communication physically looks like.[121X[133X
