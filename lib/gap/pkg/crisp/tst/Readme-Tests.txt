To run these test files, simply read the file "all.g" into GAP using `Read'
(not `ReadTest'). Their output is for information only, and can safely be
ignored. If one of the tests discovers an error, it will print an error 
message and stop. Please report any such error(s) to the author, preferably
by e-mail to b.hoefling@tu-bs.de.

You may also read individual test files into GAP after setting the following
boolean variables to `true' or `false'.

PRINT_METHODS - if true, relevant methods are printed using TraceMethods
FAST_TEST     - if true, run only small examples
DO_TIMING     - if true, measures the time required for different algorithms

FAST_TEST and DO_TIMING only affect the files whose names start with
`timing_'. Note that these files require that the package `format' is present.
PRINT_METHODS only affects the other test files.

Note that, in order to get reasonably reliable timings, one should start
GAP using the -N command line option. This ensures that all required library 
files are properly loaded before times are taken.

The following table lists the available test files and their content.

Readme-Tests.txt        -- this file

timing_normpro.g        -- tests algorithms for NormalizerOfPronormalSubgroup
timing_projectors.g     -- tests algorithms for ProjectorOp
timing_projectors_mod.g -- as timing_projectors, but uses a different library
                           method for the centralizer, which produced wrong
                           results in GAP 4.2.5
timing_radicals.g       -- tests algorithms for RadicalOp
timing_residuals.g      -- tests algorithms for ResidualOp
