      README file for the `EDIM' mini GAP4 package (Frank Lübeck)
        
To get the newest version of this  GAP 4 package download one of the archive
files
    edim-x.x.tar.gz
    edim-x.x.zoo
    edim-x.x.tar.bz2
    edim-x.x.zip
    edim-x.x-w.zip      (with text files in DOS/Windows format)
and unpack it using 
    gunzip edim-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf edim-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzoo -x edim-x.x.zoo
and so on.

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your  GAP   4   installation. It  creates a    subdirectory  called
`edim'. 

To install this package do

    cd edim
    /bin/sh ./configure [path] [CONFIGNAME=...]

where  `path' is a path to  the main GAP root  directory (if not given
the default `../..' is assumed) and CONFIGNAME describes the configuration
name of GAP for which you want to compile (if not given "default64" or
"default32" are used).

Afterwards call `make'  to  compile  a binary file. 

Repeat this for the various CONFIGNAME's for which GAP was compiled.

The package  will  also work without  this  step  but then the  kernel
function `ElementaryDivisorsPPartRkExpSmall' will not be available.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATIC LINKING: You can also create  a new statically linked `gap' binary as
follows. Go into the main GAP directory and then into `bin/..bindir..'. Here
..bindir..  means  the  directory  containing  the  `gap'  executable  after
compiling `gap'. This directory also contains the GAP compiler script `gac'.
Assuming EDIM in the standard location you can then say

   ./gac -o gap-static -P "-static" ../../pkg/edim/src/ediv.c

Then  copy  your  `gap'  start  script to,  say,  `gapbig'  and  change  the
references  to the  GAP  binary to  `gap-static'. On  my  Linux system  with
2GB  RAM and  kernel  compiled with  4GB  memory support  I  can nicely  run
`gapbig  -m 1800m  -K  1800m' and  after loading  EDIM  the kernel  function
`ElementaryDivisorsPPartRkExpSmall' is available.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recompiling the documentation is possible  by the command 'make doc' in
the EDIM directory. But this should not be necessary.

You can also run a test of the installation by 'make test'.

You must load EDIM with the command 
     gap> LoadPackage("EDIM");
within your GAP session to use its functionality. 

E-mail me if  there are any questions,  remarks,  suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
