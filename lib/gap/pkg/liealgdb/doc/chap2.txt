  
  [1X2 The families of Lie algebras included in the database[0X
  
  Here  we  describe  the  functions  that  access  the classifications of Lie
  algebras  that  are stored in the package. A function below either returns a
  single  Lie  algebra, depending on a list of parameters, or a collection. It
  is  important  to note that two calls of the function [3XNonSolvableLieAlgebra[0m,
  [3XSolvableLieAlgebra[0m,   or   [3XNilpotentLieAlgebra[0m  may  return  isomorphic  Lie
  algebras  even  if  the parameters are different (see the description of the
  parameter  list  for  each  of  the functions). If, however, the output of a
  function  is  a collection, then the members of this collection are pairwise
  non-isomorphic.
  
  The  Lie  algebras  in  the  database  are  stored  in the form of structure
  constant  tables.  Usually  the  size  of  a  family  of Lie algebras in the
  database  is  small  enough  so  that  the entries of the structure constant
  tables  can  be  stored  without  any  compression.  However  the  number of
  nilpotent  Lie  algebras with dimension at least 7 is very large, and so the
  structure  constant  tables  are compressed as follows. If $L$ is such a Lie
  algebra,  then  we  fix  a  basis  $B=\{b_1,\ldots,b_n\}$  and  consider the
  coefficients  of  the products $[b_i,b_j]$ where $j>i$. We concatenate these
  coefficient sequences and consider the long sequence so obtained as a number
  written  in  base  $p$.  Then we convert this number to base 62 and write it
  down  using the digits $0,\ldots,9,a\ldots,z,A\ldots,Z$. Then this string is
  stored  in  the  files  [3Xgap/nilpotent/nilpotent_data*.gi[0m.  See  the function
  [3XReadStringToNilpotentLieAlgebra[0m  in  the file [3Xgap/nilpotent/nilpotent.gi[0m for
  the precise details.

  between  1  and 4. The output is a non-solvable Lie algebra corresponding to
  the  parameters,  which  is displayed as a string that describes the algebra
  following  [Str].  The  first entry of [3Xpars[0m is the dimension of the algebra,

  not  greater  than  6  then  the  collection  of  nilpotent  Lie algebras is
  determined by [CGS11], otherwise the classification can be found in [Sch05].
  The  output does not contain isomorphic Lie algebras. The order in which the
  Lie  algebras appear in the collection is always the same. It is possible to
  construct  an  enumerator  from  the  output collection for all of the valid
  choices  of the parameters. See [3XAllNonSolvableLieAlgebra[0m for a more detailed
  description of usage.

  [2X> NrNilpotentLieAlgebras( [0X[3XF, dim[0X[2X ) ___________________________________[0Xmethod
  
  Here  [3XF[0m is a finite field, and [3Xdim[0m is an integer. The restrictions for [3XF[0m and
  [3Xdim[0m  are  the same as in the function [3XAllNilpotentLieAlgebras[0m. The number of
  nilpotent Lie algebras over [3XF[0m of dimension [3Xdim[0m is returned.

  [2X> LieAlgebraIdentification( [0X[3XL[0X[2X ) ______________________________________[0Xmethod
  
  Here  [3XL[0m  is  a  solvable  Lie  algebra  of  dimension  2,3, or 4, or it is a
  nilpotent  Lie  algebra  of dimension 5 or 6. This function returns a record
  with three fields.
  
  --    [3Xname[0m  This  is  a  string  containing  the name of the Lie algebra. It
        starts  with  a capital L if it is a solvable Lie algebra of dimension
        2,3,4.  It starts with a capital N if it is a nilpotent Lie algebra of
        dimension 5 or 6. A name like
  
  "N6_24( GF(3^7), Z(3^7) )"
  
        means that the input Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra with
        number  24  in  the  list  of  6-dimensional  nilpotent  Lie algebras.
        Furthermore  the  field  is  given and the value of the parameters (if
        there are any).
  
  --    [3Xparameters[0m This contains the parameters that appear in the name of the
        algebra.
  
  --    [3Xisomorphism[0m This is an isomorphism of the input Lie algebra to the Lie
        algebra from the classification with the given name.

  In the example we see that the program finds a different parameter, than the
  one with which the Lie algebra was constructed. The explanation is that some
  parametric  classes  of  Lie  algebras  contain isomorphic Lie algebras, for
  different values of the parameters. In that case the identification function
  makes its own choice.
