  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YThe need for extended functionality[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  has a lot of functionality for row echelon forms of matrices. These can
  be called by [10XSemiEchelonForm[110X and similar commands. All of these work for the
  [5XGAP[105X  matrix  type  over fields. However, these algorithms are not capable of
  computing  a reduced row echelon form (RREF) of a matrix, there is no way to
  "Gauss upwards". While this is not neccessary for things like Rank or Kernel
  computations, this was one in a number of missing features important for the
  development of the [5XGAP[105X package [5Xhomalg[105X by M. Barakat [Bar09].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YParallel  to  this  development  I  worked  on  [5XSCO[105X  [Gör08b], a package for
  creating simplicial sets and computing the cohomology of orbifolds, based on
  the  paper  "Simplicial  Cohomology  of  Orbifolds" by I. Moerdijk and D. A.
  Pronk  [MP99].  Very  early  on it became clear that the cohomology matrices
  (with  entries  in  ℤ  or finite quotients of ℤ) would grow exponentially in
  size  with the cohomology degree. At one point in time, for example, a 50651
  x 1133693 matrix had to be handled.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt should be quite clear that there was a need for a sparse matrix data type
  and  corresponding  Gaussian  algorithms.  After  an unfruitful search for a
  computer  algebra  system capable of this task, the [5XGauss[105X package was born -
  to provide not only the missing RREF algorithms, but also support a new data
  type, enabling [5XGAP[105X to handle sparse matrices of almost arbritrary size.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YI  am  proud  to  tell  you  that,  thanks  to optimizing the algorithms for
  matrices over GF(2), it was possible to compute the GF(2)-Rank of the matrix
  mentioned above in less than 20 minutes with a memory usage of about 3 GB.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YThe applications of the [5XGauss[105X[101X[1X package algorithms[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YPlease  refer  to  [ht09]  to find out more about the [5Xhomalg[105X project and its
  related  packages.  Most  of  the motivation for the algorithms in the [5XGauss[105X
  package can be found there. If you are interested in this project, you might
  also  want  to  check out my [5XGaussForHomalg[105X [Gör08a] package, which, just as
  [5XRingsForHomalg[105X  [BGKL08]  does  for external Rings, serves as the connection
  between [5Xhomalg[105X and [5XGauss[105X. By allowing [5Xhomalg[105X to delegate computational tasks
  to  [5XGauss[105X  this  small  package  extends  [5Xhomalg[105X's capabilities to dense and
  sparse matrices over fields and rings of the form [22Xℤ / ⟨ p^n ⟩[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  those  unfamiliar  with  the  [5Xhomalg[105X project let me explain a couple of
  points.  As  outlined  in  [BR08]  by  D. Robertz and M. Barakat homological
  computations can be reduced to three basic tasks:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YComputing a row basis of a module ([10XBasisOfRowModule[110X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YReducing a module with a basis ([10XDecideZeroRows[110X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YCompute      the      relations      between      module      elements
        ([10XSyzygiesGeneratorsOfRows[110X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   addition   to  these  tasks  only  relatively  easy  tools  for  matrix
  manipulation are needed, ranging from addition and multiplication to finding
  the  zero rows in a matrix. However, to reduce the need for communication it
  might be helpful to supply [5Xhomalg[105X with some more advanced procedures.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhile  the  above tasks can be quite difficult when, for example, working in
  noncommutative  polynomial  rings, in the [5XGauss[105X case they can all be done as
  long  as  you  can  compute  a  Reduced  Row Echelon Form. This is clear for
  [10XBasisOfRowModule[110X,  as the rows of the RREF of the matrix are already a basis
  of the module. [2XEchelonMat[102X ([14X4.2-1[114X) is used to compute RREFs, based on the [5XGAP[105X
  internal method [10XSemiEchelonMat[110X for Row Echelon Forms.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLets  look  at the second point, the basic function [10XDecideZeroRows[110X: When you
  face  the  task of reducing a module [22XA[122X with a given basis [22XB[122X, you can compute
  the RREF of the following block matrix:[133X
  
      ┌────┬───┐
      │ Id │ A │ 
      ├────┼───┤
      │ 0  │ B │ 
      └────┴───┘
  
  [33X[0;0YBy computing the RREF (notice how important "Gaussing upwards" is here) [22XA[122X is
  reduced  with [22XB[122X. However, the left side of the matrix just serves the single
  purpose  of  tricking  the  Gaussian  algorithms  into  doing  what we want.
  Therefore,  it was a logical step to implement [2XReduceMat[102X ([14X4.2-3[114X), which does
  the same thing but without needing unneccessary columns.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote: When, much later, it became clear that it was important to compute the
  transformation  matrices  of  the reduction, [2XReduceMatTransformation[102X ([14X4.2-4[114X)
  was  born,  similar to [2XEchelonMatTransformation[102X ([14X4.2-2[114X). This corresponds to
  the [5Xhomalg[105X procedure [10XDecideZeroRowsEffectively[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   third  procedure,  [10XSygygiesGeneratorsOfRows[110X,  is  concerned  with  the
  relations  between rows of a matrix, each row representing a module element.
  Over  a  field these relations are exactly the kernel of the matrix. One can
  easily see that this can be achieved by taking a matrix[133X
  
      ┌───┬────┐
      │ A │ Id │ 
      └───┴────┘
  
  [33X[0;0Yand  computing its Row Echelon Form. Then the row relations are generated by
  the  rows  to  the right of the zero rows of the REF. There are two problems
  with this approach: The computation diagonalizes the kernel, which might not
  be  wanted,  and,  much  worse,  it does not work at all for rings with zero
  divisors. For example, the [22X1 × 1[122X matrix [22X[2 + 8ℤ][122X has a row relation [22X[4 + 8ℤ][122X
  which would not have been found by this method.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YApproaching this problem led to the method [2XEchelonMatTransformation[102X ([14X4.2-2[114X),
  which  additionally computes the transformation matrix [22XT[122X, such that RREF [22X= T
  ⋅  M[122X.  Similar  to [10XSemiEchelonMatTransformation[110X, [22XT[122X is split up into the rows
  needed  to  create the basis vectors of the RREF, and the relations that led
  to zero rows. Focussing on the computations over fields, it was an easy step
  to  write  [2XKernelMat[102X ([14X4.2-5[114X), which terminates after the REF and returns the
  kernel generators.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  syzygy  computation  over  [22Xℤ  / ⟨ p^n ⟩[122X was solved by carefully keeping
  track   of   basis   vectors   with  a  zero-divising  head.  If,  for  [22Xv  =
  (0,...,0,h,*,...,*),  h  ≠  0,[122X  there  exists [22Xg ≠ 0[122X such that [22Xg ⋅ h = 0[122X, the
  vector [22Xg ⋅ v[122X is regarded as an additional row vector which has to be reduced
  and  can  be  reduced  with.  After  some  more  work  this  allowed for the
  implementation of [2XKernelMat[102X ([14X4.2-5[114X) for matrices over [22Xℤ / ⟨ p^n ⟩[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  concludes  the  explanation  of the so-called basic tasks [5XGauss[105X has to
  handle  when  called  by [5Xhomalg[105X to do matrix calculations. Here is a tabular
  overview of the current capabilities of [5XGauss[105X ([22Xp[122X is a prime, [22Xn ∈ ℕ[122X):[133X

  [33X[0;0YAs  you can see, the development of hermite algorithms was not continued for
  dense  matrices.  There  are two reasons for that: [5XGAP[105X already has very good
  algorithms  for ℤ, and for small matrices the disadvantage of computing over
  ℤ, potentially leading to coefficient explosion, is marginal.[133X
