Getting Semigroups
------------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4.7 package download the archive file 

    semigroups-x.x.tar.gz

from 

    http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php

and inside the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP installation unpack
semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using:

    gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar

This will create a subdirectory 'semigroups-x.x'.

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working copy of GAP with version number 4.7.3 or
higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  GAP  and instructions on how to
install it can be obtained from the main GAP webpage
  
  http://www.gap-system.org
  
The  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of Semigroups:

 1.  ensure that the IO package version 4.3 or higher is available. For more
     details go to:

       http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html
 
 2.  ensure that the Orb package version 4.7 or higher is available. For more
     details go to:

       http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html

     Note that Orb and Semigroups both perform better if Orb is compiled.

 3.  This step is optional: certain functions in Semigroups require the Grape
     package to be available and fully compiled; a full list of these functions
     can be found in the first chapter of the manual.  To use these functions
     make sure that the Grape package version 4.5 or higher is available. For
     more details go to:
  
       http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/
  
     If Grape is not fully installed, then Semigroups can be used as normal
     with  the  exception that the functions listed in the first chapter of the
     manual will not work. 

 4.  This step is optional: the non-deterministic version of the function
     Normalizer requires the genss package to be loaded. If you want to use this
     function, then please ensure that the genss package version 1.5 or higher
     is available. For more details go to:

       http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html

 5.  download the package archive 'semigroups-x.x.tar.gz' from

     http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php

 6.  unzip and untar the file 'semigroups-x.x.tar.gz' using
 
        gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar
    
     this should create a directory called 'semigroups-x.x'.

 7.  locate  the  'pkg'  directory  of your GAP directory, which contains the
     directories 'lib', 'doc' and so on. Move the directory 'semigroups-x.x'
     into the 'pkg' directory (if it is not there already).

 8.  start GAP in the usual way.

 9.  type LoadPackage("semigroups");

 10. compile the documentation by typing 
 
        SemigroupsMakeDoc();
