This file describes changes in the cvec package.

2.5.3 (2014-11-08)
  - Tweak the build system to avoid potential issues when the source

    as a method for MinimalPolynomial for row list matrices.

    done in the IO package.

1.8 (2011-03-24)
  - Slightly improved minimal polynomial routine by suggestion of
    referee.

  - Put revision 402 as version 1.8 on the web

1.7 (2007-09-26)
  - Introduce filters for cmats and cvecs to distinguish cases of q=p
    and q <= MAXSIZE_GF_INTERNAL.
  - Kernel method for cmat row access
  - Operation ScalarProductsRows with kernel method for prime fields
    used for condensation
  - Fixed infinite recursion in matrix multiplication because of
    Winograd method.
  - Fixed problem of polynomial factorisation over "DefaultField"
    instead of BaseDomain in Minimal and Characteristic polynomial
    routines.
  - New method for SumIntersectionMat for cmats. 
  - Use constructors for new objects in new interface, implement them.
  - Change all addresses to St Andrews.
  - Require GAP >= 4.4.9
  - Tune vector matrices interface and polish implementation.
  - Added a pickling/unpickling method for semi echelon basis.
  - Quite a few little changes to the vector/matrix interface
    after discussions in Braunschweig.
  - Make TraceMat compatible with GAP4R4.
  - Added matobjplist.g* from the dev library for compatibility with 4r4.
  - Put revision 324 as version 1.7 on the web.

1.6 (2007-04-02)
  - Improve MinimalPolynomialMC, change calling convention.
  - Fixed a dangerous bug in matrix multiplication using the
    memory-saving Winograd trick.
  - Better Value method for CMats (do nothing a human would not also do)
  - Put AddMatrix and MultMatrix into interface and implement it for cmats
  - Put revision 298 as version 1.6 on the web.

1.5 (2007-02-07)
  - Improve usage of grease, in particular for level 1 for 2 < q < 257
  - Improve FILL_GREASE_TAB by using trick coming from analysis: we only
    have to multiply a few times by the primitive root, not by powers of it.
  - Fixed a serious bug in SemiEchelonBasisMutableTX which occurred if
    the first row of the matrix was zero.
  - New operation CompanionMatrix (not yet documented)
  - GreaseCalibration for different machines (not yet documented)
