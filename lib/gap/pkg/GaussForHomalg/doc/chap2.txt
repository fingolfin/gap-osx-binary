  [33X[0;0YIf  you  are  just interested in using the [5XGauss[105X package with [5Xhomalg[105X, you do
  not  need  to  know  much  about  [5XGaussForHomalg[105X,  as  it  will  work in the
  background, telling [5Xhomalg[105X which functions to call.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHowever,  you might be interested in writing your own [5XXyzForHomalg[105X, enabling
  [5Xhomalg[105X  to  assist  you  with  your  computations.  For this purpose, I will
  provide  an overview of the [5XGaussForHomalg[105X code. Please note that [5XGauss[105X is a
  [5XGAP[105X  package,  therefore  this  is  not  a  reference  guide for the package
  [5XRingsForHomalg[105X,  which  utilizes the IO-stream functionality of [5XIO_ForHomalg[105X
  to send commands to external computer algebra systems. If you wish to tie an
  external system to [5Xhomalg[105X, [5XRingsForHomalg[105X is the better reference package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  file  for  all  low-level operations is [11XGaussTools.gi[111X. Like all "Tools"
  files  it  just includes one global variable [10XCommonHomalgTableForGaussTools[110X,
  which is a record of functions with [5Xhomalg[105X matrices as arguments. The return
  values  of  the  [5XGaussForHomalg[105X tools are documented in [14X3[114X and have to be the
  same for each tools table.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn this particular case, the file also includes the following code:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xif IsBound( HOMALG.OtherInternalMatrixTypes ) then[104X
    [4X    Add( HOMALG.OtherInternalMatrixTypes, IsSparseMatrix );[104X
    [4Xelse[104X
    [4X    HOMALG.OtherInternalMatrixTypes := [ IsSparseMatrix ];[104X
    [4Xfi;[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  is a specialty to explain to [5Xhomalg[105X that [5XGauss[105X introduces a new matrix
  type in [5XGAP[105X. Usually, there should not be a need for this.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  next "general" file is [11XGaussBasic.gi[111X. This includes the basic functions
  based     on     [BR08],    again    stored    in    the    global    record
  [10XCommonHomalgTableForGaussBasic[110X. Preceding this record are some small methods
  to make sure [5XGaussForHomalg[105X works with sparse as well as with dense matrices
  - just like above, these should not be neccessary in general.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   [11XGaussForHomalg.gi[111X   the  methods  for  matrix  entry  manipulation  are
  installed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  we  come  to  the  most important files, making sense of the basic
  functions   and   tools   defined  above.  Depending  on  the  functionality
  (especially concerning function names) of the system you will need different
  files for different rings. In this case, functionality for [22Xâ„¤ / n â„¤[122X is stored
  in  [11XGaussFQI.gi[111X (Finite Quotients of the Integers), while the Rationals have
  their  own  file,  [11XGaussRationals.gi[111X.  Note that both files include only one
  method,  [10XCreateHomalgTable[110X,  using  method  selection  to create the correct
  table.  Depending  on  the  properties  of the ring, the basic functions are
  loaded  and  some more "specific" functions can be defined, in this case for
  example  the  function  [2XRowReducedEchelonForm[102X  ([14X3.2-5[114X), both in a one- and a
  two-argument  version. The tools should be universal enough to be loaded for
  every  possible  ring.  If it is neccessary to overwrite a tool, this is the
  place  to  do  it. An example for this could be [2XInvolution[102X ([14X3.1-5[114X), which is
  generally just a matrix transposition, but could be overwritten to be a true
  involution when creating the [5Xhomalg[105X table for noncommutative rings.[133X
