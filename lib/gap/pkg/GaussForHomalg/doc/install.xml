<Heading>Installation of the &GaussForHomalg; Package</Heading>

To install this package just extract the package's archive file to the
GAP <F>pkg/</F> directory. By default the &GaussForHomalg; package is
not automatically loaded by &GAP; when it is installed. You must load
the package with <C>LoadPackage("GaussForHomalg");</C> before its
functions become available. Please, send me an e-mail if you have any
questions, remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning
&GaussForHomalg;. Also, I would like to hear about applications of
this package.<Br/>
