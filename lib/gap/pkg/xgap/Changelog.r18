This file describes the changes from xgap4r17 to xgap4r18:

 * XGAP now reports "4.18" as version number instead of "4.17".

 * Fix display of help pages (bug reported by Walter Neumann).
   Note that this probably will make this version incompatible with
   GAP 4.2 and earlier versions (not tested).
