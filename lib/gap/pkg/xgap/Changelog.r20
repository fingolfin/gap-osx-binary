This file describes the changes from xgap4r19 to xgap4r20:

 * XGAP now reports "4.20" as version number instead of "4.19".

 * Deleted a line in src.x11/selfile.c offending the compiler on Mac OS/X.
   Seems to work under Linux/i386 also.

 * Two changes with respect to pseudo terminals for the Windows/CYGWIN
   environment, suggested by Gary Zablackis. This is not tested.
