This file describes the changes from xgap4r15 to xgap4r16:

 * XGAP now reports "4.16" as version number instead of "4.15".

 * Thanks to Greg Gamble the html version of the documentation is now
   up to date and works with the current version of gapmacro.tex and
   convert.pl. There were quite a few small corrections in the manual.

 * There is now a pdf version of the manual included.
