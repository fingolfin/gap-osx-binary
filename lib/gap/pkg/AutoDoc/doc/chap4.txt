  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the  main  function  of  the  [5XAutoDoc[105X  package. It can perform any
  combination of the following three tasks:[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6YIt  can  (re)generate  a scaffold for your package manual. That is, it
        can  produce two XML files in [5XGAPDoc[105X format to be used as part of your
        manual:  First,  a file named [11Xdoc/PACKAGENAME.xml[111X (with your package's
        name  substituted)  which is used as main file for the package manual,
        i.e.  this file sets the XML DOCTYPE and defines various XML entities,
        includes  other  XML files (both those generated by [5XAutoDoc[105X as well as
        additional  files  created by other means), tells [5XGAPDoc[105X to generate a
        table  of  content and an index, and more. Secondly, it creates a file
        [11Xdoc/title.xml[111X  containing  a  title  page for your documentation, with
        information  about  your  package  (name,  description,  version), its
        authors and more, based on the data in your [11XPackageInfo.g[111X.[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6YIt  can  scan  your  package for [5XAutoDoc[105X based documentation (by using
        [5XAutoDoc[105X  tags  and  the Autodoc command. This will produce further XML
        files to be used as part of the package manual.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6YIt  can  use  [5XGAPDoc[105X  to  generate  PDF,  text  and HTML (with MathJaX
        enabled)  documentation from the [5XGAPDoc[105X XML files it generated as well
        as  additional  such  files  provided  by  you.  For  this, it invokes
        [2XMakeGAPDocDoc[102X  ([14XGAPDoc: MakeGAPDocDoc[114X) to convert the XML sources, and
        it  also  instructs  [5XGAPDoc[105X  to  copy supplementary files (such as CSS
        style  files) into your doc directory (see [2XCopyHTMLStyleFiles[102X ([14XGAPDoc:
