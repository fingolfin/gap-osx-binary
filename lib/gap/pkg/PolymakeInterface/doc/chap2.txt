  installed, like it is said in the polymake wiki itself. For more information
  about  this  please  visit  www.polymake.org  ([7Xhttp://www.polymake.org[107X). For
  installing  this  package, first make sure you have polymake installed. Copy
  it in your GAP pkg-directory and run the configure script (./configure) with
  your GAP root-directory as argument. The default is ../../... Then run make.
  After  this,  the package can be loaded via LoadPackage( "PolymakeInterface"
  );.[133X
