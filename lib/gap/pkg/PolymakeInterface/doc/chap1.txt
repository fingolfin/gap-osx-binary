  [33X[0;0YPolymakeInterface  is  an  GAP-Package  that provides a link to the callable
  library  of  the  CAS polymake. It is not supposed to do any work by itself,
  but  to  provide  the  methods in polymake to GAP. All the functions in this
  package  are  supposed  to  be  capsuled by functions in the Convex package,
  which  provides needed structures and datatypes. Also the functions the have
  nicer  names.  This  fact  also  causes  that there are no doumentations for
  functions in this package. To get an overview about the supported functions,
  one  might  look at the polymake_main.cpp file or simply message the author.
  Working with this package alone without Convex is not recommended.[133X
