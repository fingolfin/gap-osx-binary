 To make GAP and polymake work together porperly, one has to make sure that the two systems
 are using the same GMP library.
 You can choose the GMP which polymake uses by the flag --with-gmp=
 in the polymake configure skript.
 However, having BOTH systems using your systems GMP is HIGHLY recommended.

 This package can only be compiled on a system that has the new
 perpetual beta of polymake correctly installed,
 like it is said in the polymake wiki itself.
 For more information about this please visit <URL Text="www.polymake.org">http://www.polymake.org</URL>.
 For installing this package, first make sure you have polymake installed.
 Copy it in your GAP pkg-directory and run the configure script (./configure)
 with your GAP root-directory as argument.
 The default is ../../...
 Then run make.
 After this, the package can be loaded via LoadPackage( \"PolymakeInterface\" );.
