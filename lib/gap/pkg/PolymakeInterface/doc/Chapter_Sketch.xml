 <Description>
 This method produces the sketch output from polymake.
 Sketch have to be installed to use this method.
 The first argument must be a polymake external object,
 the second can be a filename, as a string, or a list of pairs

  <Oper Arg="arg1,arg2,arg3" Name="POLYMAKE_SKETCH_WITH_OPTIONS" Label="for IsExternalPolymakeObject, IsString, IsList"/>
 <Returns> nothing
</Returns>

 This works like the other POLYMAKE_SKETCH_WITH_DOCUMENTATION method

<ManSection>
  <Oper Arg="arg1,arg2,arg3" Name="POLYMAKE_CREATE_TIKZ_FILE" Label="for IsExternalPolymakeObject, IsString, IsList"/>
 <Returns> nothing
</Returns>
 <Description>
 This does the same as POLYMAKE_CREATE_TIKZ_FILE
 but the third argument is passed to the VISUAL command
 of polymake.
 It need to be a (possibly empty) list of options.
 The list must be consist of pairs,
 where the first entry is the name of the option
 the second the value.
 As values strings and lists of integers are allowed.

<ManSection>
  <Oper Arg="arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4" Name="POLYMAKE_CREATE_TIKZ_FILE_WITH_SKETCH_OPTIONS" Label="for IsExternalPolymakeObject, IsString, IsList, IsString"/>
 <Returns> nothing
</Returns>
 <Description>
 Works like POLYMAKE_CREATE_TIKZ_FILE with 3 arguments,
 but the last argument has to be a string of options passed directly to sketch.
 For example, if you want to have a compilable tex file build, add "-T".
