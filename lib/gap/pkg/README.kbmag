                             The KBMAG package

This is the README file for the GAP package ``kbmag''.

This package uses external binaries  and  therefore  works  only  on 
UNIX/LINUX systems.

KBMAG  (pronounced ``Kay-bee-mag'' stands  for ``Knuth--Bendix on
Monoids, and Automatic Groups''.  It  is a stand-alone package  written
in `C', for use under UNIX, with an interface to GAP.
There are interfaces for the use of KBMAG with finitely
presented groups, monoids and semigroups defined within  GAP.
The package also contains a collection of routines for manipulating
finite state automata, which can be accessed via the GAP interface.

It will work only on GAP versions >= 4.3.

To complete the installation of the  ``kbmag''  package  go  to  the
directory `kbmag' created (the directory contains  a  copy  of  this
README file) and call

  /bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you
would call

  /bin/sh ./configure ../..

and then call

  make 
  
to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you  must  execute  the
configure/make steps for  the  ``kbmag''  package  on  each  of  the
architectures  immediately  after  configuring  GAP  itself  on   this
architecture.

Full information and documentation is in the `doc' directory. Call

  make texdoc

to create the file `doc/manual.dvi'.
