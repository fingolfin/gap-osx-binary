4ti2Interface is an GAP-Package that provides a link to the
CAS 4ti2. It is not supposed to do any work by itself, but to provide
the methods in 4ti2 to GAP.
At the moment, it only capsules the groebner and hilbert method in 4ti2
but there are more to come.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me,
