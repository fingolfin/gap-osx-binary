Full documentation for this package is contained in the files in info.d.
The sources of all 'C' programs and makefile are contained in progs.d.
To compile everything go into progs.d and type
make all
The executable binaries are put into exec.d.  Some Bourne shell programs (in
particular, cohomology) are also in exec.d.
The user's path should therefore contain the directory  exec.d.
Computations are usually carried out from within data.d, which
contains all data files for groups.

The cohomology programs would run into problems with
primes >=100, although the testmf program (which does elementary matrix ops
modulo an integer) should work with bigger moduli. 
Please let me know of any error found as soon as possible.
