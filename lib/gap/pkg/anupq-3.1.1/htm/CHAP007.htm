<p>
The ANU  <code>pq</code> program is  written in C  and the package can  be installed
under UNIX  and in environments  similar to UNIX. In particular
it is known to work on Linux and Mac OS X, and also on Windows
equipped with cygwin.
<p>
The current version of the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font>  package  requires at least <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.5,
and version 1.5 of the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">AutPGrp</font> package. However, we recommend using
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>&nbsp;4.6 or newer.
<p>
To install the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font> package, move the file <code>anupq-</code><var>XXX</var><code>.tar.gz</code> for some
version number <var>XXX</var> into the  <code>pkg</code>  directory  in  which  you  plan  to
install <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font>. Usually, this  will  be  the  directory  <code>pkg</code>  in  the
hierarchy of your version of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>; it is  however  also  possible  to
keep an additional <code>pkg</code> directory in your private directories. The  only
essential difference  with  installing  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font>  in  a  <code>pkg</code>  directory
different to the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> home directory is that one  must  start  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
with the <code>-l</code> switch (see Section&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/ref/chap3.html#X782751D5858A6EAF">Command  Line  Options</a>),  e.g.&nbsp;if
your private <code>pkg</code> directory is a subdirectory of <code>mygap</code>  in  your  home
directory you might type:
<p>
<code>gap -l ";</code><var>myhomedir</var><code>/mygap"</code>
<p>
where <var>myhomedir</var> is the  path  to  your  home  directory,  which 
may be replaced  by  a  tilde.  The  empty  path  before  the
semicolon is  filled  in  by  the  default  path  of  the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  home
directory.
<p>
Then, in your chosen <code>pkg</code> directory, unpack <code>anupq-</code><var>XXX</var><code>.tar.gz</code> by
<p>
<code>tar xf anupq-</code><var>XXX</var><code>.tar.gz</code>
<p>
Change to the newly created <code>anupq</code>  directory.  Now  you  need  to  call
<code>configure</code>. If you installed <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font> into the  main  <code>pkg</code>  directory,
call
<p>
<pre>
./configure
</pre>
<p>
If you installed ANUPQ in another directory than the usual 'pkg'
subdirectory, instead call
<p>
<pre>
./configure --with-gaproot=&lt;path&gt;
</pre>
<p>
where <var>path</var> is the path to the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> home directory. (You can also call
<p>
<pre>
./configure --help
</pre>
<p>
for further options.)
<p>
What this does is look for a file <code>sysinfo.gap</code> in the root directory  of
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> in order to determine an architecture name for the subdirectory of
<code>bin</code> in which to put the compiled <code>pq</code> binary. This only makes sense  if
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> was compiled for the same architecture that <code>pq</code> will be.  If  you
have a shared file system mounted across  different  architectures,  then
you should run <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code> for <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font> for each  architecture
immediately after compiling <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> on the same architecture.
<p>
If you had to install the package in your own directory but wish  to  use
the system <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> then you will need to find out what <var>path</var> is. To  do
this, start up <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> and find  out  what  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>'s  root  path  is  from
finding the value of the  variable  <code>GAPInfo.RootPaths</code>, e.g.
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; GAPInfo.RootPaths;
[ "/usr/local/lib/gap4r4/" ]
</pre>
<p>
would tell you to use <code>/usr/local/lib/gap4r4</code> for <var>path</var>.
<p>
The <code>configure</code> command will fetch the architecture type for which <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
has been compiled  last and  create  a  <code>Makefile</code>. You  can  now
simply call
<p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.
<p>
<a name = "I0"></a>

The path of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> (see <strong>Note</strong> below) used by the <code>pq</code> binary (the  value
<code>GAP</code> is set to in the <code>make</code> command) may be over-ridden by setting  the
environment variable <code>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</code>. These values are only of  interest
when the <code>pq</code> program is run  as  a  standalone;  however,  the  <code>testPq</code>
script assumes you have set one of these correctly (see  Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP007.htm#SECT001">Testing your ANUPQ installation</a>). When the <code>pq</code> program is started  from  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
communication occurs via an iostream, so that the <code>pq</code>  binary  does  not
actually need to know a valid path for <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is this case.
<p>
<strong>Note.</strong> By ``path of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>'' we mean the path of  the  command  used  to
invoke <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> (which  should  be  a  script,  e.g.  the  <code>gap.sh</code>  script
generated in the <code>bin</code> directory for the version of  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  when  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
was compiled). The usual strategy is to copy the  <code>gap.sh</code>  script  to  a
standard location, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin/gap</code>. It is a mistake to copy the
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  executable  <code>gap</code>   (in   a   directory   with   name   of   form
<code>bin/</code><var>compile-platform</var><code></code>)  to  the  standard   location,   since   direct
invocation of the executable results in  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  starting  without  being
able to find its own library (a fatal error).
<p>
<p>
<h2><a name="SECT001">7.1 Testing your ANUPQ installation</a></h2>
<p><p>
<a name = "I1"></a>

Now it is time to test the  installation.  After  doing  <code>configure</code>  and
<code>make</code> you will have a <code>testPq</code> script. The script assumes that,  if  the
environment variable <code>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</code> is set, it is a  correct  path  for
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, or otherwise that the <code>make</code> call that compiled the  <code>pq</code> program
set <code>GAP</code> to a correct path  for  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>  (see  Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP007.htm#SECT002">Running  the  pq program as a standalone</a> for more details). To run the tests, just type:
<p>
<pre>
./testPq
</pre>
<p>
Some of the tests the script runs take a while. Please  be  patient.  The
script checks that you not only have a correct <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> (at  least  version
4.5) installation that includes the  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">AutPGrp</font>  package,  but  that  the
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font> package and its <code>pq</code> binary interact correctly. You  should  see
something like the following output:
<p>
<pre>
Made dir: /tmp/testPq
Testing installation of ANUPQ Package (version 3.1)
 
The first two tests check that the pq C program compiled ok.
Testing the pq binary ... OK.
Testing the pq binary's stack size ... OK.
The pq C program compiled ok! We test it's the right one below.
 
The next tests check that you have the right version of GAP
for the ANUPQ package and that GAP is finding
the right versions of the ANUPQ and AutPGrp packages.
 
Checking GAP ...
 pq binary made with GAP set to: /usr/local/bin/gap
 Starting GAP to determine version and package availability ...
  GAP version (4.6.5) ... OK.
  GAP found ANUPQ package (version 3.1) ... good.
  GAP found pq binary (version 1.9) ... good.
  GAP found AutPGrp package (version 1.5) ... good.
 GAP is OK.
 
Checking the link between the pq binary and GAP ... OK.
Testing the standard presentation part of the pq binary ... OK.
Doing p-group generation (final GAP/ANUPQ) test ... OK.
Tests complete.
Removed dir: /tmp/testPq
Enjoy using your functional ANUPQ package!

<h2><a name="SECT002">7.2 Running the pq program as a standalone</a></h2>
<p><p>
<a name = "I2"></a>

When the <code>pq</code> program is run as a standalone it sometimes  needs  to call
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> to compute stabilisers of subgroups; in doing so, it first  checks
the value of the environment variable <code>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</code>, and uses that, if
set, or otherwise the value of <code>GAP</code> it was compiled with,  as  the  path
for  <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>.  If  you  ran  <code>testPq</code>  (see  Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP007.htm#SECT001">Testing  your  ANUPQ installation</a>) and you got both <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is <code>OK</code> and the link  between  the
<code>pq</code> binary and <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is <code>OK</code>, you should be fine.  Otherwise  heed  the
recommendations of the error messages you get and run the <code>testPq</code>  until
all tests are passed.
<p>
It is especially important that the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>, whose path you  gave,  should
know where to find the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font> and <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">AutPGrp</font> packages. To  ensure  this
the path should be to a shell script that invokes <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>. If  you  needed
to install the needed packages in your own directory (because,  say,  you
are not a system administrator) then you should  create  your  own  shell
script that runs <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> with a correct setting of the <code>-l</code> option and set
the path used by the <code>pq</code> binary to the path of that  script.  To  create
the script that runs <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> it is easiest to copy the system one and edit
it, e.g. start by executing the following UNIX commands (skip the  second
step if you already have a <code>bin</code>  directory;  <code>you@unix&gt;</code>  is  your  UNIX
prompt):
<p>
<pre>
you@unix&gt; cd
you@unix&gt; mkdir bin
you@unix&gt; cd bin
you@unix&gt; which gap
/usr/local/bin/gap
you@unix&gt; cp /usr/local/bin/gap mygap
you@unix&gt; chmod +x mygap
</pre>
<p>
At the second-last step use the path of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> returned by  <code>which  gap</code>.
Now hopefully you will have a copy of the script  that  runs  the  system
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> in <code>mygap</code>. Now use your favourite editor to edit the <code>-l</code> part of
the last line of <code>mygap</code> which should initially look something like:
<p>
<pre>
exec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l $GAP_DIR $*
</pre>
<p>
so that it becomes (the tilde  is  a  UNIX  abbreviation  for  your  home
directory):
<p>
<pre>
exec $GAP_DIR/bin/$GAP_PRG -m $GAP_MEM -o 970m -l "$GAP_DIR;~/gapstuff" $*
</pre>
<p>
assuming that your personal <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> <code>pkg</code> directory is a  subdirectory  of
<code>gapstuff</code> in your home directory. Finally, to let the <code>pq</code> program  know
where <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> is and also know where your <code>pkg</code> directory is that contains
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">ANUPQ</font>, set the environment variable <code>ANUPQ_GAP_EXEC</code> to  the  complete
(i.e. absolute) path of  your  <code>mygap</code>  script  (do  not  use  the  tilde
abbreviation).

<h2><a name="SECT003">7.3 Setting the Verbosity of ANUPQ via Info and InfoANUPQ</a></h2>
<p><p>
<a name = "SSEC003.1"></a>
<li><code>InfoANUPQ V</code>
<p>
The input to and the output from the <code>pq</code> program  is,  by  default,  not
displayed. However the user may choose to  see  some,  or  all,  of  this
input/output.   This   is   done   via   the   <code>Info</code>   mechanism    (see
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/ref/chap7.html#X7A9C902479CB6F7C">Info Functions</a> in the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference  Manual).  For  this
purpose, there is the <var>InfoClass</var>  <code>InfoANUPQ</code>.  If  the  <code>InfoLevel</code>  of
<code>InfoANUPQ</code> is high enough each line of <code>pq</code> input/output is directed  to
a call to <code>Info</code> and will be displayed for the user to see.  By  default,
the <code>InfoLevel</code> of <code>InfoANUPQ</code> is 1, and it is recommended that you leave
it at this level, or higher. Messages that  the  user  should  presumably
want to see and output from the <code>pq</code> program influenced by the  value  of
the option <code>OutputLevel</code> (see the options listed in Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP004.htm#SSEC001.1">Pq</a>),  other
than timing and memory usage are directed to <code>Info</code> at <code>InfoANUPQ</code>  level
1.
<p>
To turn off <strong>all</strong> <code>InfoANUPQ</code> messaging, set the <code>InfoANUPQ</code> level to 0.
<p>
There are five other user-intended <code>InfoANUPQ</code> levels: 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 2);
</pre>
<p>
enables the display of most timing and memory usage data  from  the  <code>pq</code>
program, and also the number of identity instances when the  <code>Identities</code>
option is used. (Some timing and memory  usage  data,  particularly  when
profuse in quantity, is <code>Info</code>-ed at <code>InfoANUPQ</code> level 3  instead.)  Note
that the the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> functions <code>time</code> and <code>Runtime</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="../../../doc/ref/chap7.html#X7E32B27F81870D24">Runtime</a>  in
the <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> Reference Manual) count the time spent by <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> and <strong>not</strong> the
time spent by the (external) <code>pq</code> program.
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 3);
</pre>
<p>
enables the display of output of the nature of the first two  <code>InfoANUPQ</code>
that was not directly invoked by the  user  (e.g.&nbsp;some  commands  require
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> to discover something about the current state known  to  the  <code>pq</code>
program). The identity instances processed under the <code>Identities</code>  option
are also displayed at  this  level.  In  some  cases,  the  <code>pq</code>  program
produces a  lot  of  output  despite  the  fact  that  the  <code>OutputLevel</code>
(see&nbsp;<a href="CHAP006.htm#SSEC001.9">option OutputLevel</a>) is unset or is set to 0; such output  is  also
<code>Info</code>-ed at <code>InfoANUPQ</code> level 3.
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 4);
</pre>
<p>
enables the display of all the commands  directed  to  the  <code>pq</code>  program,
behind a ``<code>ToPQ&gt; </code>'' prompt (so that you can  distinguish  it  from  the
output from the <code>pq</code> program). See Section&nbsp;<a href="CHAP003.htm#SECT006">Hints and Warnings  regarding the use of  Options</a>  for  an  example  of  how  this  can  be  a  useful
troubleshooting tool.
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 5);
</pre>
<p>
enables the display of the <code>pq</code> program's prompts for input. Finally,
<p>
<pre>
gap&gt; SetInfoLevel(InfoANUPQ, 6);
</pre>
<p>
enables the display of all other output from the <code>pq</code> program, namely  the
banner and menus. However, the timing data printed when the  <code>pq</code>  program
exits can never be observed.
