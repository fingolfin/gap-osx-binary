The files: 5gpA, pga_example and pga_interactive use the basic  format
for inputting relations and so the pq program must be called with  the
`-b' flag for these.

Those files which begin with keyword_ are examples of files containing
presentations defined using key words i.e.  the  pq  program  must  be
called with the `-k' flag.

For all other input files the pq program  should  be  called  with  no
flags.

All files beginning  with  pga_  are  examples  of  usage  of  p-group
generation, except that:  pga_template  is  a  template  for  creating
p-group generation input files.

All input files not  beginning  with  pga_  utilize  features  of  the
p-quotient algorithm.

For Version 1.6 of pq, the following line was added to each pga_ file:

0       #number of soluble automorphisms
