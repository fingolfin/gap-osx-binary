#Example: "B2-4-Id" . . . alternative way to generate B(2, 4)
#Generates B(2, 4) by using the `Identities' option
#... this is not as efficient as using `Exponent' but
#demonstrates the usage of the `Identities' option.
#vars: F, f, procId;
#options: 
F := FreeGroup("a", "b");
## All words w in the pc generators of B(2, 4) satisfy f(w) = 1 
f := w -> w^4;
