/* this procedure collect extra relations which hold in the group;

   it may be used as an exponent check routine for certain 
   Burnside computations; 

   if pcp->extra_relations = 0 there are no extra relations;

   if pcp->extra_relations > 0, the extra relations specify that  
   certain pcp words have exponent pcp->extra_relations -- those 
   normal pcp words with weights from pcp->start_wt to end_class;

   if pcp->end_wt > 0, end_class is set to the minimum of pcp->cc and 
   this value;

   if both pcp->end_wt and pcp->start_wt are 0, this ensures that the 
   group has exponent pcp->extra_relations; 

   if ALL_WORDS is chosen, then the routine generates a complete
   list of the normal words needed in exponent checking whose
   weights lie within the chosen bounds;

   if REDUCED_LIST is chosen, it is assumed that all redundant 
   relations in the queue are later closed under supplied 
   automorphisms which must contain a generating set for the 
   appropriate general linear group;
   
   if INITIAL_SEGMENT is chosen, the routine will read in a word 
   and only generate all those words needed for exponent checking 
   which have this word as a proper initial segment; 

   any redundancies obtained by echelonising the members of this
   list are added to the supplied queue; 

   there are a number of options in this code which are selected
   according to the value of the following variables:

   if exp_flag->process is FALSE, generate the list of words but do 
   not process the elements; if diagnostic output, then print out
   all words which will be collected;

   if exp_flag->complete is TRUE and diagnostic output is chosen,
   then print out all of the words of the appropriate weight 
   generated and not just those which survive the conjugacy and 
   other tests;

   hence, if you want a listing of all of the words generated using the
   back-track search, you should set both flags TRUE;

   if exp_flag->partitions is TRUE, print the weight partitions 
   of the generated words; */
