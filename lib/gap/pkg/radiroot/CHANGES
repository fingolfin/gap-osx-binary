 This file describes changes in 'RadiRoot' beginning from version 2.1:
===========================================================================

==========================
 Changes from 2.6 -> 2.7:  (09/04/2014)
==========================

  - fixed bug in output regarding the powers of the root of unity reported
    by Daniel Blazewicz on 31/03/2014 
  - coefficients in representations of cyclics elements in the output are now
    reduced (as follow-up to a suggestion by Daniel Blazewicz)

==========================
 Changes from 2.5 -> 2.6:  (04/11/2011)
==========================

  - replacing the archive that mistakenly became public as 2.5 

==========================
 Changes from 2.4 -> 2.5:  (28/10/2011)
==========================

  - adjusted package to GAP 4.5 and new location of homepage
  - fixed bug reported by Max Horn, regarding method selection,
    added TryNextMethod in various methods which are for rational
    polynomials, to delegate other polynomials to appropriate methods

==========================
 Changes from 2.3 -> 2.4:  (22/01/2008)
==========================

  - Corrected documentation, reported by David Sevilla
  - Bug for linear polynomials reported by David Sevilla fixed in 
    'RR_RootOfUnity' (introduced with the fix in 2.3)
  - Polynomials for which the cyclotomic polynomial would splitt in
    non-linear factors over the splitting field the subsequent function
    calls to the main functions would give wrong results. FIXED
  - Introduced method for 'IsomorphismMatrixField' for the Rationals
  - Corrected output for polynomial 'x'

==========================
 Changes from 2.2 -> 2.3:  (15/06/2007)
==========================

  - Testfile with examples from documentation added
  - Bug in 'RR_RootOfUnity' reported by David Sevilla fixed by use of
    'IsomorphismMatrixField' instead of 'EquationOrderBasis' 

==========================
 Changes from 2.1 -> 2.2:  (09/05/2007)
==========================

  - Added this file to document the changes between versions.
  - Introduced a copyright.
  - Improvements in documentation due to the final report of the referee.
  - New status of the package is 'accepted'. :)
