                       CHANGES to the Gpd package 

ToDo 
 - (14/01/13) It seems that operations such as WeightedSpanningTree have 
              recently been included in grpgraph.gi but not yet used in 
              any example or test file: so need to work on this. 
              So far there is no implementation of WeightedAdjacencyMatrix. 
 - (17/04/13) Referee's report contains a number of typos, comments, 
              and suggestions, which all need attention. 
 - (21/11/14) Arrows are the elements in any mwo, but in a groupoid the code 
              still makes GroupoidElement different - but IsGroupoidElement 
              is declared to be a synonym of Arrow in gpd.gi. 
              This needs to be sorted out: maybe the ElementFamilies need 
              to be different but, when it comes to composition of arrows 
              the type of mwo hardly matters!? 
 - (05/06/15) need lots more work on normal forms - see referee's comments

              and archive files in the format  gpd-1.13.tar 

############################################################################## 
1.09 -> 1.12  (21/09/11) 

 - (20/09/11) new version of makedocrel.g for building the manual 
              added file gpd/examples/readall.g for testing purposes

              Improved GroupoidAutomorphismByRayImages(NC).

              Fixed some subgroupoid functions, using IsList instead of 
              IsHomogeneousList, since the groups may be of differing types.

               Rewrote the method for Ancestor. 
 - (16/05/11) Added method for IsWide in mwo.gi

               Improved InverseGeneralMapping for groupoid homomorphisms. 
 - (27/01/11) Big changes to groupoid homomorphisms, with the idea that 
               only simple functions should be provided, and more complicated 
               morphisms constructed by composition: 
               - added GroupoidHomomorphismByGroupHom, 
               - removed GroupoidHomomorphismFromSinglePiece, 
               - rewrote global function GroupoidHomomorphism. 
 - (26/01/11) Added operations RootGroup and RaysOfGroupoid.  
               Rewrote SubgroupoidWithRays. 
               Renamed LeftProdsOfRays as RayProducts, 
               and .rayConjugators as .rays .
 - (22/01/11) Changed AutomorphismGroup and NiceObjectAutoGroupGroupoid 
               by putting the group automorphisms before the object perms. 
 - (20/01/11) Finished new version of AutomorphismGroup for a groupoid: 
               includes function: NiceObjectAutoGroupGroupoid. 
 - (19/01/11) Renamed the 08.05 functions GroupoidMappingBy... 
               as GroupoidAutomorphismBy... and did major editing. 
 - (14/01/11) Constructed rep of the automorphism group of a groupoid 
               as a quotient of a semidirect product of perm groups 
               (i.e. implementing Prop.3.1 in Alp/Wensley 2010). 
 - (13/01/11) Corrected IdentityMapping for groupoids. 
               Fixed ParentAttr in FullSubgroupoid. 
 - (12/01/11) Checked the order for maps: [ src, rng, hom, imobs ].
               Implemented  m1*m2  when m1,m2 have several pieces. 
               Renamed ObjectPermOfGroupoidHomomorphism 
                    as ObjectTransformation OfGroupoidHomomorphism 
               and added MappingTransObjectsImages. 
               Added TestAllProductsUnderGroupoidHomomorphism. 
               Rename the following: 
                    MagmaHomomorphism..Piece.. -> Homomorphism..Piece.., 
                  IsHomomorphismWithObjectsRep -> IsMappingWithObjectsRep, 
                IsHomomorphismToSinglePieceRep -> IsMappingToSinglePieceRep
 - (02/01/11) Added checks in GroupoidHomomorphismFromSinglePiece. 
 - (21/09/10) Added operation RootObject. 
               Added LargerDirectProductGroupoid for IsSinglePieceRaysRep, 
               so a RaysRep groupoid is a subgroupoid of a direct product 
               groupoid, which may in turn have a larger parent. 
               Added operation ReplaceOnePieceInUnion. 
 - (20/09/10) Implemented ConjugateGroupoid and removed ConjugateSubgroupoid. 
               MultiplicativeElementWithObjectsNC how has first parameter 
               'isgpdelt', which is true for groupoid elements and, 
               when true, elements have GroupoidElementsFamily. 
               This allows special methods for elements of groupoids. 
 - (08/09/10) Deleted chunks of code into file oldgpd.gdi :- 
               IsGroupoid, IsGroupoidElementRep, GroupoidElementNC. 
               Added ViewObj method for homs with more than one piece. 
               Added IsInjectiveWithObjects, IsSurjectiveWithObjects 
               methods for homs with more than one piece. 
 - (07/05/10) Added example of homomorphism S123 -> T123
 - (06/05/10) Reversed the pair in PieceImages: now  [ hom, imobs ]
 - (05/05/10) Added \^(e,p) for element in MonoidWithObjects and an Int  
 - (05/05/10) Changed GeneratorsOfMagmaWithObjects from Attribute to Operation 
               returning Attribute GeneratorsOfMagma(WithOne/Inverses). 
 - (05/05/10) Added sections on SemigroupsWithObjects and MonoidsWithObjects 
               to the manual. 
 - (30/04/10) Introduced MultiplicativeElementWithObjectsFamily 
               so now 'FamilyObj(e)!.mwo' fails to work. 
               Decided to try to do without saving the mwo with the element. 
               (For now avoid separate family for each groupoid.) 
               Also renamed IsMultiplicativeElementWithObjectsAndInverses 
               as IsGroupoidElement, and added the family of these. 
               Also added GroupoidFamily, GroupoidElementFamily. 
 - (30/04/10) IsGroupoidHomomorphism renamed IsGroupWithObjectsHomomorphism 
               and introduced new category IsGroupoidHomomorphism with 
               corresponding collection and family constructions. 
 - (26/04/10) Testing a trivial version of AutomorphismGroup( gpd ); 
 - (23/04/10) In mwo.gd added MagmaWithObjectsFamily, and used this family 
               in SinglePieceMagmaWithObjects when applying Objectify, 
               so that now IsMagmaWithObjectsCollection( [M78] ); is true! 
               Ditto GeneralMappingWithObjectsFamily in mwohom.gd(i). 
               IsGeneratorsOfMagmaWithInverses in gpdaut.gi now works. 
               ?? Can now get rid of all the .eltsfam's ?? probably not! 
 - (20/04/10) Copied method for IsGeneratorsOfMagmaWithInverses 
               from grpmat.gi, but does not work at present. 
 - (16/04/10) Started files  gpdaut.gd  and  gpdaut.gi  and introduced 
               IsAutomorphismGroupOfGroupoid, GroupoidActedUpon (??) 
 - (15/04/10) Renamed SinglePieceGroupoidWithRays as SubgroupoidWithRays 
 - (26/03/10) Moved Gpd development to IMac at home, and started v.1.07

               Completed the change of parameter order to "<mag>,<obs>",
 - (19/11/08) GapDoc relegated to "suggested other packages".

               with Mapping -> Homomorphism (and ***map.* -> ***hom.*), 
 - (17/11/08) IsMappingSinglePieceSinglePiece -> IsMappingFromSinglePiece, 
               MagmaMappingWithCommonRange -> MappingToSinglePiece, 
               MappingOfSinglePieces -> MappingFromSinglePiece, 
               MappingFromSinglePiece -> MagmaMappingFromSinglePiece, 
               MagmaMappingByPieces -> MappingByUnion, 
               IsSinglePiece now (IsMagmaWithObjects and IsSinglePieceDomain), 
               and similarly for IsDiscrete 
               and IsDirectProductWithCompleteGraph, 
               added global function GroupoidMapping, 
 - (14/11/08) added InverseGeneralMapping method for 
                 IsGroupoidMapping and IsMappingSinglePieceSinglrPiece,
               omitted morgraph.gd(gi) and reinstated grpgraph, gpdgraph : 
               needed to replace \in by IsElementInGroupoid many times; 
               still a problem with \* for GraphOfGroupoidsWords

##############################################################################
1.03 -> 1.04  (13/11/2008)

problem: need to redefine PieceImages in light of DefaultGroupoidMappingRep ? 
         need elements for this new submagma representation

               added GNU General Public License declaration,
               moved some XMod utilities to gpd/gap/util.gd(gi),

               got rid of the PosRep representation (not being used); 
               redefined IsSemigroupMappingWithObjects, 
               IsMonoidMappingWithObjects and IsGroupoidMapping;

 - (14/10/08) added new methods for MultiplicativeElementWithObjects; 
               added property IsMappingSinglePieceSinglePiece;

               added representation IsSubmagmaWithObjectsTableRep, 
               and operations IsSubmagmaWithObjectsGeneratingTable, 
               SubmagmaWithObjectsElementsTable, 
               and SubmagmaWithObjectsByElementsTable; 
 - (10/10/08) Functions coming from preprint 08.05 :-

               : GroupoidMappingOfSinglePieces, 
               : MappingPermObjectsImages, 
               : GroupoidMappingByObjectImages, 
               : GroupoidMappingByGroupHom, 
               : GroupoidMappingByRayProds, 
 - (10/10/08) should IeEndomorphismWithObjects be IsEndoGeneralMapping ?? 
               introduced IsDefaultGroupoidMappingRep; 
               added attribute ImagesOfRays; 
               added operation MappingPermObjectsImages; 
               renamed MappingOfSinglePiecesNew 
               as MappingOfSinglePiecesGeneratorsImages  -  is it needed?
 - (09/10/08) found there is a problem in LeftCosetsNC  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
               converted "Morphism" to "Mapping" throughout: 
               this includes replacing "mor" by "map" in filenames;  
               replaced "IsMagmaMappingWithObjects" 
                   with "IsSemigroupMappingWithObjects"; 
               found lots of "Constituents" in the library, 
               so changed "Constituents" to "Pieces"; 
 - (06/10/08) added Display for MagmaWithObjects; 
               converted Iterator from Groupoid to MagmaWithObjects; 
               problems with Group(mor1a,mor1b) in mwomor.g
 - (03/10/08) added SubgroupoidBySubgroup; 
               rewrote attribute GeneratorsOfMagmaWithObjects 
               called by operation GeneratorsOfGroupoid; 
               removed test for U to be wide in G for (Right/Left)Coset, 
               and at the same time introduced attribute SuperDomain; 
               wondered whether to introduce category IsPermWithObjects? 
 - (25/09/08) new method for FullSubgroupoid; 
               changed IsSubgroupoid to an Operation from GlobalFunction 
               and split into a collection of methods; 
               fixed bug in \= for groupoids;  
 - (24/09/08) new category IsDomainWithObjects >= IsMagmaWithObjects 
               and global function DomainWithObjects 
               ApplyToSingleObject -> DomainWithSingleObject 
               ObjectMagma(s) -> ObjectDomain(s) . . . needs to be checked? 
               SubmagmaWithObjects -> SubdomainWithObjects, etc. 
 - (18/09/08) New function HomsetCosetsGroupoidCoset 
               used for RightCoset( sgpd, e ) and LeftCoset( sgpd, e )
               but more work needed when there are several constituents. 
 - (12/09/08) SingleConstituentGroupoidWithRays now a subgroupoid of an 
               IsDirectProductWithCompleteGraph and with the same objects. 
               RootGroup is now stored as .magma
               HomsetCosetsRep now has a sixth parameter - the rays. 
               ObjectStar, ObjectCostar, Homset all edited , 
               UnionHomsets removed as not needed. 
 - (03/09/08) SetParent for Submagma : Magma now AttributeStoring
 - (01/09/08) Converted old IsSubgroupoid to IsSubmagmaWithObjects etc. 
 - (04/04/08) Replaced GpdBuildManual() by file makedocrel.g
 - (20/03/08) Functions renamed as follows:
     : ObjectsOfGroupoid -> ObjectList
     : ConstituentsOfGroupoid -> Constituents
     : GroupoidByUnion(NC) -> UnionOfConstituents(NC)
     : GroupAsGroupoid -> ApplyToSingleObject 
     : IsGroupoidRep -> IsConstituentsRep 
     : IsStandardConnectedGroupoid -> IsDirectProductWithCompleteGraph
     : IsConnectedGroupoidRep -> IsGroupoidWithObjectsCompRep 
     : IsConnectedGroupoidWithRaysRep -> IsSingleConstituentRaysRep
     : ConnectedGroupoid(NC) -> SingleConstituentGroupoid 
     : ConnectedGroupoidWithRays(NC) -> SingleConstituentGroupoidWithRays(NC) 
     : ConnectedGroupoidByGenerators -> SingleConstituentGroupoidByGenerators 
     : GroupElement -> Arrow 
     : Tail -> Arrowtail 
     : Head -> Arrowhead
 - (14/03/08) Started new files: mathcat.gd and mathcat.gi
               initially with small bits taken from: gpd.gd and gpd.gi. 
               Tried to add some digraph functions there . . . 
               but these should be in files: digraph.gp and digraph.gi.
 - (13/03/08) Since 'component' is used in ComponentObjectRep, etc., 
               changed ComponentsOf... to ConstituentsOf... 
 - (11/03/08) MathCat now a Category, and not a Property 
 - (11/03/08) Revised: IsPermGroupoid, IsFpGroupoid, IsPcGroupoid 
 - (11/03/08) Revised: PrintObj and ViewObj 
 - (11/03/08) Replaced test for IsPcGroupoid with IsPolycyclicGroup(g) 
 - (06/03/08) Need: ConnectedGroupoidByGenerators( gens ) etc.
 - (06/03/08) Method for GeneratorsOfGroupoid in the non-connected case. 
 - (05/03/08) Expanded conjugation operator, e1^e2, following preprint 07.10

1.01 -> 1.03  (08/10/2007)

 -  Started this CHANGES file. 
 -  Now using GAPDoc-1.0.
 -  Fixed some bugs in the example files. 
 -  New versions of MorphismToConnectedGroupoid, MorphismOfConnectedGroupoids
      have been started, but are not called and require further revision. 
 -  Created a test file:  gpd_manual.tst  called by  testall.g 
 -  Started to reintroduce connected groupoids with variable object groups: 
      added: IsGroupoidWithConstantGroup, ConnectedGroupoidWithRays(NC). 
      Note: many of the other functions do not yet work with these groupoids.
