                   The Gpd package - version 1.34

This is the README file for the GAP package ``Gpd''. 

This package allows for the computation of finite groupoids, both connected
and with several components.  Graphs of groups and graphs of groupoids are
also constructed, allowing the calculation of normal forms for Free Products
with Amalgamation and for HNN extensions when the initial groups have
rewriting systems.
