<Heading>Versions of the Package</Heading>

The first version, <Package>GraphGpd</Package> 1.001, 
formed part of Emma Moore's thesis <Cite Key="emma-thesis" /> in December 2000,
but was not made generally available.
<P/>
Version 1.002 of <Package>GraphGpd</Package> 
was prepared to run under &GAP; 4.4 in January 2004; 
was submitted to the &GAP; council to be considered as an accepted package; 
but suggestions from the referee were not followed up.
<P/>
In April 2006 the manual was converted to <Package>GAPDoc</Package> format.
Variables <C>Star</C>, <C>Costar</C> and <C>CoveringGroup</C> were
found to conflict with usage in other packages, and were renamed 
<C>VertexStar</C>, <C>VertexCostar</C> and 
<C>CoveringGroupOfGroupoid</C> respectively. 
Similarly, the <C>Vertices</C> and <C>Arcs</C> of an <C>FpWeightedDigraph</C> 
were changed from attributes to record components.
<P/>
In the spring of 2006 the package was extensively rewritten 
and renamed &gpd;. 
Version 1.01 was submitted as a deposited package in June 2006.
Version 1.03, of October 2007, fixed some file protections, 
and introduced the test file <F>gpd_manual.tst</F>. 
<P/>
Version 1.05, of November 2008, was released when the website 
at Bangor changed. 
<P/>
Since then, the package has been rewritten again, 
introducing magmas with objects and their mappings. 
Functions to implement constructions contained in <Cite Key="AlWe" /> 
have been added, but this is ongoing work. 
<P/> 
Versions 1.09 to 1.15 were prepared for the anticipated release of &GAP; 4.5 
in June 2012. 
<P/> 
&gpd; became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015. 
<P/>
The latest version is &VERSION; of &GPDRELEASEDATE;, for &GAP; 4.7.

<Heading>What needs to be done next?</Heading>

Computationally, there are three types of connected groupoid:
<List>
<Item>
those with identical object groups,
</Item>
<Item>
those with object groups conjugate in some supergroup,
</Item>
<Item>
those with object groups which are simply isomorphic. 
</Item>
</List>

<Package>GraphGpd</Package> attempted to implement the second case, 
while &gpd; 1.01 and 1.03 considered only the first case, 
and &gpd; 1.05 extended 1.03 to the second case. 
<P/> 
The third case has not yet been considered for implementation, 
and there does not appear to be much need to do so. 
<P/> 
Here are some other immediate requirements: 
<List>
<Item>
more work on automorphism groups of groupoids; 
</Item>
<Item>
normal subgroupoids and quotient groupoids;
</Item>
<Item>
more methods for morphisms of groupoids, 
particularly when the range is not connected; 
</Item>
<Item>
<C>ImageElm</C> and <C>ImagesSource</C> 
for the cases of groupoid morphisms not yet covered;
</Item>
<Item>
<C>Enumerator</C> for <C>IsHomsetCosetsRep</C>;
</Item>
<Item>
free groupoid on a graph;
</Item>
<Item>
methods for <C>FreeProductWithAmalgamation</C> and <C>HnnEntension</C> 
for pc-groups; 
</Item>
<Item>
convert <C>GraphOfGroupsRewritingSystem</C> to the category 
<C>IsRewritingSystem</C>;
</Item>
<Item>
in <Package>XMod</Package>, implement crossed modules over groupoids 
(a start has been made).
