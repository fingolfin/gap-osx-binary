        Main CHANGES between versions of the Browse package

1.8.5
  - "Further improvement" of the Ctrl-M issue from 1.8.4.
  - Fixed two problems with non-breakable spaces in gap-publishednicer.bib.
  
1.8.4
  - Fixed the handling of the 'version' component of database attributes;
    before the fix, it was possible that an attribute was regarded as
    up-to-date, without checking the version number in the data file.
  - Avoid literal Ctrl-M characters to work around a bug in Windows 8.

1.8.3
  - The new user preference 'EnableMouseEvents' sets the default behaviour
    for the GAP session.
    Enabling/disabling mouse events is now regarded as one global status
    in the current GAP session,
    and browse applications should not set this status when they are entered.
    Note that more and more browse tables are opened from within other
    browse tables, and it is not clear to the user where this happens.
    Thus it does not make sense to assign a ``mouse events status value''
    to individual browse tables.
    As a consequence, the component 'dynamic.useMouse' in the records
    processed by 'NCurses.BrowseGeneric' is now obsolete;
    we keep this component because some code may rely on its presence,
    but its use is not recommended.
  - Avoid some compiler warnings with 'gcc -Wall' for gcc >= 4.6 (by
    wrapping the macro wattr_get in a function).
  - Changed encoding of Makefile.in to UTF-8 and setting LANG and LC_ALL to
    "C" ./configure script (this is workaround to some problems with 'sed' 
    on newer OS X systems).
  - Fixed 'BrowseGapMethods', 'BrowsePackageVariables', and 'BrowseProfile':
    Up to now, the attempt to show the code of a function in a pager
    ran into an error if the file in question is not available, or if the
    'FilenameFunc' value of the function involves the string "GAPROOT"
    (which happens for compiled functions in lib)
    [This bug had been reported by Vinay Wagh.]
  - Fixed 'BrowseAtlasInfo':
    Up to now, unnecessary lines at the end of the details table were
    possible.
  - We now handle the case when TERM is not set at all in environment
    (e.g., when workspaces are created from cron jobs).
  - Extended 'NCurses.Select', as follows:
    - support mouse events (and to enable/disable mouse events)
    - admit "fit" as the value of the 'size' component,
      meaning the smallest possible window size
    - admit an optional 'align' component,
      meaning the alignment of the window in the terminal
    - admit an attribute number instead of 'true'
      for the optional 'border' component
  - New applications 'BrowseUserPreferences', 'BrowseTomLibInfo'.
  - Extended 'BrowseGapData' and its documentation.

1.8.2
 - `BrowseAtlasInfo' now admits a user input 'Y' (show an overview of the
   entries chosen for the result) and prints a message in the footer whenever
   a new entry is added to the result.
 - `BrowsePackageVariables' now admits also the same argument syntax as the
   GAP library function `ShowPackageVariables', which is simpler than the one
   which has to be used for packags that are loaded before `Browse'.
   `BrowsePackageVariables' shows now also the comments of method
   installations, corresponding to the extension of the GAP library function
   `ShowPackageVariables'.
 - `NCurses.Select' now admits entering digits, in order to jump to the next
   row whose label matches the given number.

1.8.1
 - improved README before release of GAP 4.5
 - made the compiler call in Makefile more flexible: can now give additional
   options to C compiler and change the linker options
 - introduced a non-documented (and not recommended) hook to load Browse
   without ncurses and so no visual capabilities

1.8
 - improved support for the case that the environment variable TERM
   has the value "dumb":
   - exit from `NCurses.BrowseGeneric', do not try to switch to visual mode
   - do not switch to visual mode in NCurses.{Select,Pager,Alert}
   - change user preferences to 'false'
   - `NCurses.attrs.ColorPairs' is available in this case;
     a manual/test example was adjusted to this situation
 - 'BrowsePackageVariables' is now documented, because it will be
   cross-referenced from the GAP Reference Manual
 - minor improvements of database attributes:
   - set a default 'version' component for attributes
   - automatically recompute needed attributes that are not up-to-date
   - improved some 'Info' statements

1.7
 - in the case that the output is redirected to a file,
   avoid printing control sequences to this file,
   by setting the TERM variable to 'dumb'
 - improved `NCurses.Select':
   searching and filtering is now possible,
   and an optional `onSubmitFunction' is supported;
   these features are used in GAP's online help
 - fixed a bug with the choice of parameters in the search dialog box
 - support replay with history when calling `BrowseAtlasInfo'
 - overwrite the library function `GetPackageNameForPrefix'
   (open a pager instead of just showing a list of matching entries)
 - use GAP's user preferences for controlling the online help
   and `GetPackageNameForPrefix';
   by default, the variants with Browse support are chosen
 - changed the default for case sensitivity from case sensitive to case
   insensitive in the dialog boxes for searching, sorting, and filtering
 - removed the function `BibEntry',
   which is available in the GAP 4.5 library

1.6
 - support replay with history when calling the `Browse' method for
   character tables and `BrowseDecompositionMatrix'
 - improved `NCurses.ConcatenationAttributeLines' (adjacent strings are
   concatenated)

1.5
 - new example application `NCurses.BrowseDenseList' and `Browse' methods
   for lists of lists, and several kinds of matrices over finite rings
 - extended `BrowseBibliography' by a MSC info column,
   added the new function `BrowseMSC' that shows an overview of all current
   MSC codes
 - new example application `BrowseDecompositionMatrix' for character tables

1.4
 - provide NCurses.IsStdoutATty and NCurses.IsStdinATty, such that something
   sensible can be done in scripts or testing environments.
 - The functions used by `NCurses.BrowseGeneric' now work also when the
   output is redirected to a file.
   In particular, the file `tst/test.tst' can now be read in the background.
 - `BrowseAtlasInfo' was adjusted to the extended functionality of
   `DisplayAtlasInfo' (for GAP 4.5), and it shows now also the available
   straight line programs and related information.
 - The new example application `BrowsePackageVariables' was added.
   Currently it is undocumented, as is the analogous GAP library function
   `ShowPackageVariables'.

1.3
 - bugfixes:
   * In some situations, it had been impossible to scroll back to the first
     column once one had scrolled to the right.
   * Sorting a browse table with hidden rows by a column could yield a wrong
     result.
   * Showing text containing unprintable characters could result in error
     messages; now `BrowseData.SimplifiedString' is called in the relevant
     example applications (for example in the online help).
   * The global variable `d' (if bound) does not get a (new) value when
     the package gets loaded.
   * `BrowseDirectory' does no longer run into an error if some files in
     question are not readable.
 - new example application `BrowseProfile' (for GAP 4.5); it uses the
   currently undocumented new utility `NCurses.EditFields'
 - changed example application `BrowseGapMethods':
   * A list of operations can be entered as an optional argument.
   * The browse table is more flexible using successive categorization.
     Up to now, it was pre-categorized by operations and number of arguments.
   * Two new columns showing package names and filenames were added.
   * If the source file of the ``clicked'' method is known (this works from
     GAP 4.5 on) then this file is opened instead of showing the code of the
     function obtained with `Print'.
 - `BrowseAtlasInfo' can now be called also with a group name as its first
   argument, and it amits also the conditions (such as `IsPermGroup') that
   are admissible for `DisplayAtlasInfo'.
   The return value of the function was changed,
   now the records in the list do no longer contain the generators themselves;
   one can get the generators from these records (which are returned also by
   `OneAtlasGeneratingSetsInfo') by calling `AtlasGenerators'.
 - in `BrowseGapManuals', use `NCurses.Pager' only if the user defined pager
   is "builtin"; otherwise, use the user defined pager
 - in `BrowseGapPackages', use the global function `BibEntry' (which is
   available in the GAP 4.5 library) not `BrowseData.BibEntry'
 - generalized undocumented functions:
   * `BrowseData.SetActions' has now an optional argument that allows one
     to replace existing actions.
   * `BrowseData.PositionInBrowseTable' computes also the positions in
     header or footer.
   * `BrowseData.ReallyFormatParagraph' admits left alignment
   * `BrowseData.CompareAsNumbersAndNonnumbers' is now more efficient
 - new search/filter parameter "mode" ("substring" or "whole entry"),
   which allows one to search for whole entries and not only for substrings;
   in this case, one can search also w.r.t. "<", "<=" etc.,
   not only w.r.t. "=" or "<>"
 - successive categorization by table columns is now supported (up to now,
   existing category lines were erased upon categorizing by a column)
 - new optional third argument <what> for `DatabaseAttributeCompute'
 - changed the encoding of the files to UTF-8

1.2
 - several bug fixes, concerning
   * `BrowseTableFromDatabaseIdEnumerator' and its data format,
   * the line grid (for cells that are higher or wider than the screen), and
   * the sorting of tables in certain situations,
 - several small improvements, such as
   * a ``status bar'' in visual mode, indicating that GAP is still computing
     (that is, the screen is not yet updated),
   * a new search/filter parameter "negate", which allows one to restrict a
     table to all rows *not* matching a certain string,
   * speedup for example of sorting/categorizing, and
   * better `minyx' functions in `Browse' for character tables, which makes
     it possible to show tables with large headers on small screens,
 - new example application `BrowseTransitiveGroupsInfo'
 - rearranged example application `BrowseBibliography':
   * now it is based on database id enumerators,
   * it is more flexible via the possibility to use a record as its argument,
   * duplicate entries in the input files are supported,
   * character replacements in the input are now left to GAPDoc (using, e.g.,
     `SimplifiedUnicodeString'), and
   * new actions for showing the three formats of a selected entry were added
 - extended example application `BrowseGapPackages':
   * be aware of an empty `Persons' component in a `PackageInfo.g' file
     (up to know, this had caused an error),
   * distinguish direct and indirect dependencies,
   * improved category values in tables categorized by needed/suggested
     packages,
   * changed output format (equal to that of `BrowseBibliography')

1.1
 - after loading a workspace re-initialize kernel part of NCurses (which
   depends on type of current terminal)
 - fixed the bug that the brk-prompt sometimes was moved to the wrong
   line of the screen
 - added low level support for mouse events in visual mode and used it in
   some applications
 - made sure that TERM is set when kernel module is loaded to avoid
   exit when ncurses is initialized
 - again bugfixes in functions used by `NCurses.BrowseGeneric'
 - new feature ``database attributes'' (described in a manual appendix)
 - new (trivial but extendible) application `BrowseGapData',
   with some subapplications such as `BrowseConwayPolynomials'

1.0  generic special grid from line drawing characters,
     new actions: scroll home/end
     added components `isRejectedLabelsCol', `isRejectedLabelsRow'
     (use them in a new action for character tables)

0.99 a few bug fixes in applications,
     adjustments to the forthcoming version of GAPDoc,
     new `NCurses.BrowseGeneric' application `BrowseDirectory'
     new `NCurses.BrowseGeneric' feature ``filtering''
     extended `BrowseBibliography' to XML format source files
     (and changed the output format)


0.9  first public release with requests for comments.
