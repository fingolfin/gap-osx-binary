\Chapter{Introduction}

This package provides \GAP-functions to reproduce the experimental
results described in our paper \cite{ER09}.

More precisely, it provides
\beginlist
\item{$\bullet$} functions to determine the rank, width and obliquity
  of a finite $p$-group,
\item{$\bullet$} functions to investigate the graph of all finite $p$-groups of a
  given rank, width and obliquity using the ANUPQ-package \cite{ANU06}, and
\item{$\bullet$} a library of finite quotients of certain infinite pro-$p$-groups
  of finite rank, width and obliquity.
\endlist
