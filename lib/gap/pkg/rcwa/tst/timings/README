                README file for directory 'rcwa/tst/timings'

The purpose of this otherwise empty directory  is to store information on the
performance of tests. This information is stored once the user runs  the test
suite of the package,  i.e.  calls RCWATestAll();.  It is used  in subsequent
runs of the test suite  for comparing  former and present runtimes of indivi-
dual commands.
