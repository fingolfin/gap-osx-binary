This chapter explains functionality for looking for nice quotients of
modules.

<Chapter Label="quotfinder">
<Heading>Finding nice quotients</Heading>

This chapter will be written when the <Package>chop</Package> is
documented and released, because the functions to be described here
depend on that package.

<P/>
For the moment it should be enough to say that the functions to 
be described here are used to find nice quotient modules for the
orbit algorithms using the orbit-by-suborbit techniques described
in Chapter <Ref Chap="bysuborbit"/>.
