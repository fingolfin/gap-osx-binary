This directory contains the GAPDoc source files needed to produce
the manual of QuaGroup. The files are

      * quagroup.xml   (the xml file, contains almost everything),
      * quagroup.bib   (contains the bibliography).

The manual can be produced in GAP (when GAPDoc is loaded) with the command

    gap> MakeGAPDocDoc( ".", "quagroup",  [], "quagroup", "MathJax" );;
    gap> CopyHTMLStyleFiles(".");
