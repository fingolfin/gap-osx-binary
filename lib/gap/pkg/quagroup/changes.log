Changes 1.0 -- 1.1

   * Added the function HWModuleByTensorProduct.

   * Removed the record QGOptions (we want the modules to tore their
     sparse matrices anyway, and also we want to store the canonical
     elements).

   * Calculation of the comultiplication map when the Hopf structure
     is twisted is a lot faster now.

Version 1.7, 1.8:

   * manual now also uses MathJax.
