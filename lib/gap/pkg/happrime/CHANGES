Version 0.6: 2011/06/09
    Removed the functions that were moved into HAP in the previous version.
      This has made HAPprime much smaller and simpler, and the test routines
      and documentations have been alterered correspondingly.
    Minor updates for compatibility with GAP 4.5

Version 0.5: 2009/09/07
  [Graham Ellis] Added a few warnings in certain functions so that the user 
    can only apply them to 2-groups. He also added the functions for 
    2-groups to the main HAP code. So now HAPprime only loads these itself 
    if HAP (version >=1.9) is not loaded.

Version 0.4: 2008/12/22 
  [Graham Ellis] The name of the function "ModPCohomologyRingPresentation" has 
    been changed to "Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation". This function, and also 
    "PoincareSeriesLHS", now return an error message when applied to p-groups 
    (p>=3) rather than the wrong answer.

Version 0.3: 2008/12/10
  Major internal changes and bug fixes to the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral
    sequence code
  New HAPRingHomomorphism datatypes 
  New KernelOfModuleHomomorphismGF function and ResolutionPrimePowerGroupGF2
    function which offer an alternative to the earlier low-memory version
    (it is currently not _better_ than the earlier version, but with more
    work it could be)

Version 0.2.1: 2008/9/15
  Now requires HAP version >= 1.8.9
  Improvements to ModPCohomologyRingPresentation. It now returns the known
    result if the group is cyclic, and splits the problem if the group can be
    decomposed into direct factors. It now recursively calls itself to calculate
    the presentations for smaller groups, so the presentations will be correct
    by induction.

Version 0.2: 2008/8/22
  Added functions to compute and use the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral
    sequence to compute provablycorrect mod-p cohomology rings and 
    Poincare series.
  Manual now split into two: a userguide and a datatypes reference manual
  New test files, including testing all of the manual examples

Version 0.1.3: 2008/2/8
  Improvements and bug-fixes to derivations, and added HomologyOfDerivation 
  function

Version 0.1.2: 2007/1/28
  Added derivations, in particular the KernelOfDerivation function
  Fixed warnings about multiple defined operations (not visible because of HAP 
  bug)

Version 0.1.1: 2007/12/20
  Added PresentationOfGradedStructureConstantAlgebra() function

Version 0.1.0: 2007/09/25
  First public release
