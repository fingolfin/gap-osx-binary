  
  [1X1 Introduction[0X
  
  
  [1X1.1 Introduction to the [5XHAPprime[1X package[0X
  
  [5XHAPprime[0m    is   a   package   for   the   [5XGAP[0m   computer   algebra   system
  ([7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org/[0m), and which extends the [5XHAP[0m `Homological Algebra
  Progamming'        package        written        by       Graham       Ellis
  ([7Xhttp://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/[0m).  It  provides  algorithms  and data
  structures  for  calculating  resolutions  of  small prime-power groups. The
  [5XHAPprime[0m  functions  use  significantly  less  memory  than  the  equivalent
  function in [5XHAP[0m, allowing resolutions (and cohomology ring presentations) of
  larger groups to be calculated (see Section [14X2.2[0m).
  
  Earlier  versions  of [5XHAPprime[0m also included functions to compute polynomial
  ring  presentations  of cohomology rings, and to ensure that these rings are
  complete  and  correct.  These  functions  have  now been moved into the [5XHAP[0m
  package  and  are  documented  as  part  of  that  package  (see for example
  [2XMod2CohomologyRingPresentation[0m      ([14XHAP:     Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation
  (HAPprime)[0m) and [2XPoincareSeriesLHS[0m ([14XHAP: PoincareSeriesLHS (HAPprime)[0m)).
  
  
  [1X1.2 Required software[0X
  
  The  [5XHAPprime[0m  package  requires  [5XGAP[0m version 4.4 or greater and [5XHAP[0m version
  1.9.3 or greater.
  
  
  [1X1.3 Installing [5XHAPprime[1X[0X
  
  To  install  the  [5XHAPprime[0m  Package,  unpack  the archive file into your [5XGAP[0m
  packages  directory  (either  usually  the  [11Xpkg[0m  directory  of  your  [5XGAP[0m  4
  installation  if you have access to it, or some local [11Xpkg[0m directory that [5XGAP[0m
  can find). The [5XHAPprime[0m files will all be installed in a subdirectory called
  [11Xhapprime[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.4 Loading and testing [5XHAPprime[1X[0X
  
  The  [5XHAPprime[0m  package is not loaded by default when [5XGAP[0m is started. To load
  the package, type the following at the [5XGAP[0m prompt:
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage( "HAPprime");[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  If [5XHAPprime[0m isn't already in memory, it is loaded and the author information
  is  displayed.  If  you  are a frequent user of [5XHAPprime[0m, you might consider
  putting this line in your [11X.gaprc[0m file, or using the [10XPackagesToLoad[0m option in
  your [11Xgap.ini[0m file.
  
  The correct installation of [5XHAPprime[0m can be tested by using the test routine
  [11Xtst/testall.g[0m:
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4Xgap> ReadPackage("HAPprime", "tst/testall.g");[0X
    [4X+ HAPprime version 0.5.1[0X
    [4X general tests[0X
    [4X+ GAP4stones: 371057[0X
    [4X+ HAPprime version 0.5.1[0X
    [4X userguide examples[0X

  The  number  of  [10XGAP4stones[0m  will  vary  depending  on your machine, but any
  additional lines of messages indicate problems with your installation.
  
  The test routine calls a set of test files [14X'Reference: Test Files'[0m which can
  be  found  in  the  [11Xtst[0m  directory  of the [5XHAPprime[0m installation. All of the
  routines  listed  in this user guide are tested, as are many of those in the
  datatype reference manual.
  
  
  [1X1.5 Documentation[0X
  
  The  documentation  for  [5XHAPprime[0m is in two parts. This document is the user
  guide,  which covers the main functions provided by [5XHAPprime[0m and examples of
  their  use.  There  is  also  a  more technical [5XHAPprime[0m datatypes reference
  manual  which  gives  details  of  the  new  [5XGAP[0m  datatypes defined and used
  internally  by  [5XHAPprime[0m,  as  well  as outlining the algorithms used by the
  package.
  
  [1X1.5-1 MakeHAPprimeDoc[0m
  
  [2X> MakeHAPprimeDoc( [0X[3X[manual-name][0X[2X ) _________________________________[0Xfunction
  [6XReturns:[0X  nothing
  
  The  two  manuals supplied with [5XHAPprime[0m - this user guide and the datatypes
  reference manual - are written using the [5XGAPDoc[0m package and are available in
  PDF,  HTML  and  text  format.  It  should not be necessary to rebuild these
  files, but should you wish to do so then this can be done using the function
  [2XMakeHAPprimeDoc[0m.
  
  The  optional  argument  [3Xmanual-name[0m is a string specifying which manuals to
  build. It may be one of the following
  
  --    [10X"all"[0m builds both manuals. This is the default
  
  --    [10X"userguide"[0m builds just the user guide
  
  --    [10X"datatypes"[0m builds just the datatypes reference manual
  
  --    [10X"internal"[0m  builds  both manuals, including the otherwise undocumented
        internal functions
  
  --    [10X"testexamples"[0m  builds  neither  manual, but tests all of the examples
        using [2XTestManualExamples[0m ([14XGAPDoc: TestManualExamples[0m)
  
  As  well  as building the manuals, this function at the same time builds [5XGAP[0m
  test  files  [14X'Reference:  Test  Files'[0m  which means that all of the testable
  examples in the manuals are added to the [5XHAPprime[0m test routines described in
  Section [14X1.4[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.6 Displaying progress and calculation information[0X
  
  By  default,  the  functions  in  [5XHAPprime[0m  display  no  output  (except for
  returning the result). The [10XInfoHAPprime[0m info class can be used to enable the
  printing  of  progress  and calculation information during processing. Since
  some  computations  with  [5XHAPprime[0m can take several hours, setting this to a
  higher  level  can  be  particularly  useful  for monitoring the progress of
  computations.
  
  [1X1.6-1 InfoHAPprime[0m
  
  [2X> InfoHAPprime____________________________________________________[0Xinfo class
  
  The  [10XInfoHAPprime[0m  info  class  is used throughout the [5XHAPprime[0m package. Use
  [10XSetInfoLevel(InfoHAPprime,  [0m[3Xlevel[0m[10X)[0m  to  change  the  amount  of  information
  displayed   about   the   progress  of  the  computation  (see  [2XSetInfoLevel[0m
  ([14XReference:  SetInfoLevel[0m)  in  the  [5XGAP[0m  reference  manual).  The different
  distinct levels are:
  
  --    [10X0[0m print nothing (this is the default)
  
  --    [10X1[0m   print   some   information,  mainly  progress  information  during
        computations that may take some time
  
  --    [10X2[0m  print  more  detailed  information,  incluing  details  of internal
        calculations
