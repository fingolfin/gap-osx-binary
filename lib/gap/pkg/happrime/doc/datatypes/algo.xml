    <Heading>Algorithms</Heading>
    
    The algorithms in &HAPprime; are designed for computations
    over <M>\mathbb{F}G</M>-modules and <M>\mathbb{F}G</M>-module homomorphisms.
    These are both represented using lists of generating vectors and 
    permutation group actions. Matrix methods
    are used for much of the computation, and although the groups are small,
    the vector spaces involved become large. Memory use is therefore the main 
    concern in these algorithms, and here we describe how the block structure
    of the vectors used in our representation enables some memory savings to be
    made.
