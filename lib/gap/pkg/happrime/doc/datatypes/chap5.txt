  
  [1X5 General Functions[0X
  
  Some  of  the  functions  provided by [5XHAPprime[0m are not specifically aimed at
  homological  algebra  or  extending  the  [5XHAP[0m package. The functions in this
  chapter,  which  are used internally by [5XHAPprime[0m extend some of the standard
  [5XGAP[0m functions and datatypes.
  
  
  [1X5.1 Matrices[0X
  
  For  details of the standard [5XGAP[0m vector and matrix functions, see [14X'Tutorial:
  matrices'[0m  and  [14X'Reference:  Matrices'[0m  in  the  [5XGAP[0m  tutorial and reference
  manuals.  [5XHAPprime[0m provides improved versions of a couple of standard matrix
  operations, and two small helper functions.
  
  [1X5.1-1 SumIntersectionMatDestructive[0m
  
  [2X> SumIntersectionMatDestructive( [0X[3XU, V[0X[2X ) ___________________________[0Xoperation
  [2X> SumIntersectionMatDestructiveSE( [0X[3XUbasis, Uheads, Vbasis, Vheads[0X[2X ) [0Xoperation
  
  Returns  a  list  of  length  2  with, at the first position, the sum of the
  vector spaces generated by the rows of [3XU[0m and [3XV[0m, and, at the second position,
  the intersection of the spaces.
  
  Like     the    [5XGAP[0m    core    function    [2XSumIntersectionMat[0m    ([14XReference:
  SumIntersectionMat[0m),  this  performs  Zassenhaus' algorithm to compute bases
  for the sum and the intersection. However, this version operates directly on
  the  input matrices (thus corrupting them), and is rewritten to require only
  approximately  1.5  times  the  space  of  the  original  input matrices. By
  contrast,  the  original  [5XGAP[0m  version  uses  three  times the memory of the
  original  matrices  to  perform the calculation, and since it doesn't modify
  the  input  matrices  will  require  a  total of four times the space of the
  original matrices.
  
  The  function  [9XSumIntersectionMatDestructiveSE[0m takes as arguments not a pair
  of  generating  matrices,  but a pair of semi-echelon basis matrices and the
  corresponding   head   locations,   such   as  is  returned  by  a  call  to
  [2XSemiEchelonMatDestructive[0m   ([14XReference:   SemiEchelonMatDestructive[0m)  (these
  arguments must all be mutable, so [2XSemiEchelonMat[0m ([14XReference: SemiEchelonMat[0m)
  cannot    be    used).    This    function    is    used    internally    by
  [9XSumIntersectionMatDestructive[0m,  and  is  provided for the occasions when the
  user might already have the semi-echelon versions available, in which case a
  small amount of time will be saved.
  
  [1X5.1-2 SolutionMat[0m
  
  [2X> SolutionMat( [0X[3XM, V[0X[2X ) _____________________________________________[0Xoperation
  [2X> SolutionMatDestructive( [0X[3XM, V[0X[2X ) __________________________________[0Xoperation
  
  Calculates, for each row vector v_i in the matrix [3XV[0m, a solution to x_i x M =
  v_i,  and  returns these solutions in a matrix X, whose rows are the vectors
  x_i.  If  there  is not a solution for a v_i, then [9Xfail[0m is returned for that
  row.
  
  These   functions   are   identical  to  the  kernel  functions  [2XSolutionMat[0m
  ([14XReference:     SolutionMat[0m)    and    [2XSolutionMatDestructive[0m    ([14XReference:
  SolutionMatDestructive[0m), but are provided for cases where multiple solutions
  using the same matrix [3XM[0m are required. In these cases, using this function is
  far faster, since the matrix is only decomposed once.
  
  The  [10XDestructive[0m  version  corrupts  both  the  input  matrices,  while  the
  non-[10XDestructive[0m version operates on copies of these.
  
  [1X5.1-3 IsSameSubspace[0m
  
  [2X> IsSameSubspace( [0X[3XU, V[0X[2X ) __________________________________________[0Xoperation
  
  Returns  [9Xtrue[0m  if the subspaces spanned by the rows of [3XU[0m and [3XV[0m are the same,
  [9Xfalse[0m otherwise.
  
  This  function  treats the rows of the two matrices as vectors from the same
  vector  space  (with the same basis), and tests whether the subspace spanned
  by the two sets of vectors is the same.
  
  [1X5.1-4 PrintDimensionsMat[0m
  
  [2X> PrintDimensionsMat( [0X[3XM[0X[2X ) _________________________________________[0Xoperation
  
  Returns  a  string  containing  the  dimensions  of the matrix [3XM[0m in the form
  [10X"mxn"[0m,  where  [9Xm[0m  is  the number of rows and [9Xn[0m the number of columns. If the
  matrix is empty, the returned string is [10X"empty"[0m.
  
  
  [1X5.1-5 Example: matrices and vector spaces[0X
  
  [5XGAP[0m  uses rows of a matrix to represent basis vectors for a vector space. In
  this  example we have two matrics U and V that we suspect represent the same
  subspace.  Using  [2XSolutionMat[0m  ([14X5.1-2[0m)  we  can  see  that  V lies in U, but
  [2XIsSameSubspace[0m  ([14X5.1-3[0m)  shows  that  they  are  the  same  subspace,  as is
  confirmed by having identical sums and intersections.

  [1X5.2 Groups[0X
  
  Small  groups  in  [5XGAP[0m  can  be indexed by their small groups library number
  [14X'Reference:  Small  Groups'[0m. An alternative indexing scheme, the Hall-Senior
  number,  is  used by Jon Carlson to publish his cohomology ring calculations
  at [7Xhttp://www.math.uga.edu/~lvalero/cohointro.html[0m. To allow comparison with
  these results, we provide a function that converts from the [5XGAP[0m small groups
  library  numbers to Hall-Senior number for the groups of order 8, 16, 32 and
  64.

  [2X> HallSeniorNumber( [0X[3XG[0X[2X ) ___________________________________________[0Xattribute
  [6XReturns:[0X  Integer
  
  Returns the Hall-Senior number for a small group (of order 8, 16, 32 or 64).
  The  group  can be specified an [3Xorder[0m, [3Xi[0m pair from the [5XGAP[0m [14X'Reference: Small
  Groups'[0m  library,  or  as  a group [3XG[0m, in which case [2XIdSmallGroup[0m ([14XReference:
  IdSmallGroup[0m) is used to identify the group.
