                             The MapClass package

This is the README file for the GAP package "MapClass". This README is based on
the README for the "Example" package by Nickel and Gamble.

The package can be found at the following mirrors:

http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/~jamesa/mapclass/


or via the Packages links from the GAP sites

http://www.gap-system.org/                       (UK)

If you prefer tar.gz or tar.bz2 to zoo archives, substitute tar.gz  or
tar.bz2 (as appropriate) for zoo in the above paths.

     Installing  a complete MapClass package 

Place the entire ``MapClass'' folder into your `pkg' directory or run
using GAP's root flag (-l).

    gap -l '/home/user/gap/pkg'

That's it. Now start GAP and type

  LoadPackage("mapclass");

The ``MapClass" package banner should appear on the screen.
