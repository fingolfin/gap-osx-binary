  [33X[0;0YIn this chapter we first explain what a [21Xdocument type definition[121X is and then
  describe  [11Xgapdoc.dtd[111X  in detail. That file together with the current chapter
  define  how  a [5XGAPDoc[105X document has to look like. It can be found in the main
  directory of the [5XGAPDoc[105X package and it is reproduced in Appendix [14XB[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  do  not  give  many examples in this chapter which is more intended as a
  formal  reference  for  all  [5XGAPDoc[105X  elements.  Instead  we provide an extra
  document  with  book name [10XGAPDocExample[110X (also accessible from the [5XGAP[105X online
  help).  This  uses all the constructs introduced in this chapter and you can
  easily compare the source code and how it looks like in the different output
  formats.  Furthermore  recall  that  many basic things about XML markup were
  already explained by example in the introductory chapter [14X1[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is a DTD?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  document  type  definition  (DTD)  is  a formal declaration of how an XML
  document  has  to  be structured. It is itself structured such that programs
  that handle documents can read it and treat the documents accordingly. There
  are  for  example parsers and validity checkers that use the DTD to validate
  an XML document, see [14X2.1-14[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  main  thing  a  DTD  does  is  to  specify  which elements may occur in
  documents  of  a  certain  document  type,  how they can be nested, and what
  attributes they can or must have. So, for each element there is a rule.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  a  DTD  can [13Xnot[113X ensure that a document which is [21Xvalid[121X also makes
  sense  to  the converters! It only says something about the formal structure
  of the document.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the  remaining  part  of  this  chapter we have divided the elements of
  [5XGAPDoc[105X  documents  into  several subsets, each of which will be discussed in
  one of the next sections.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSee the following three subsections to learn by example, how a DTD works. We
  do  not want to be too formal here, but just enable the reader to understand
  the  declarations  in  [11Xgapdoc.dtd[111X. For precise descriptions of the syntax of
  DTD's see again the official standard in:[133X

  [33X[0;0YA  [5XGAPDoc[105X  document  contains on its top level exactly one element with name
  [10XBook[110X. This element is declared in the DTD as follows:[133X

    [4X<!ATTLIST Book Name CDATA #REQUIRED>[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YAfter  the keyword [10XELEMENT[110X and the name [10XBook[110X there is a list in parentheses.
  This  is a comma separated list of names of elements which can occur (in the
  given  order) in the content of a [10XBook[110X element. Each name in such a list can
  be  followed  by  one  of  the  characters  [21X[10X?[110X[121X,  [21X[10X*[110X[121X  or  [21X[10X+[110X[121X,  meaning  that the
  corresponding  element  can  occur  zero or one time, an arbitrary number of
  times,  or  at least once, respectively. Without such an extra character the
  corresponding  element  must occur exactly once. Instead of one name in this
  list  there  can also be a list of elements names separated by [21X[10X|[110X[121X characters,
  this denotes any element with one of the names (i.e., [21X[10X|[110X[121X means [21Xor[121X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo,  the  [10XBook[110X  element  must  contain  first  a  [10XTitlePage[110X element, then an
  optional  [10XTableOfContents[110X  element,  then  a [10XBody[110X element, then zero or more
  elements  of  type  [10XAppendix[110X,  then  an  optional  [10XBibliography[110X element, and
  finally an optional element of type [10XTheIndex[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  [13Xonly[113X  these  elements  are  allowed  in  the content of the [10XBook[110X
  element.  No  other  elements or text is allowed in between. An exception of
  this  is  that  there  may  be whitespace between the end tag of one and the
  start  tag of the next element - this should be ignored when the document is
  processed  to  some output format. An element like this is called an element
  with [21Xelement content[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  second declaration starts with the keyword [10XATTLIST[110X and the element name
  [10XBook[110X.  After  that  there is a triple of whitespace separated parameters (in
  general  an arbitrary number of such triples, one for each allowed attribute
  name).  The first ([10XName[110X) is the name of an attribute for a [10XBook[110X element. The
  second ([10XCDATA[110X) is always the same for all of our declarations, it means that
  the  value  of the attribute consists of [21Xcharacter data[121X. The third parameter
  [10X#REQUIRED[110X means that this attribute must be specified with any [10XBook[110X element.
  Later we will also see optional attributes which are declared as [10X#IMPLIED[110X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YWithin  this  element information for the title page is collected. Note that
  more  than  one  author  can  be specified. The elements must appear in this

  [21Xthe following elements may occur in any order but each exactly once[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBefore  going  on with the other elements inside the [10XBook[110X element we explain

  [33X[0;0YHere  is  the  last construct you need to understand for reading [11Xgapdoc.dtd[111X.
  The  expression [21X[10X%Text;[110X[121X is a so-called [21Xparameter entity[121X. It is something like
  a macro within the DTD. It is defined as follows:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  From gapdoc.dtd  [32X[104X
    [4X<!ENTITY % Text "%InnerText; | List | Enum | Table">[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  means,  that  every occurrence of [21X[10X%Text;[110X[121X in the DTD is replaced by the
  expression[133X
  
  [4X[32X  From gapdoc.dtd  [32X[104X
    [4X%InnerText; | List | Enum | Table[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhich is then expanded further because of the following definition:[133X

  [33X[0;0YThese are the only two parameter entities we are using. They expand to lists
  of  element  names which are explained in the sequel [13Xand[113X the keyword [10X#PCDATA[110X
  (concatenated with the [21Xor[121X character [21X[10X|[110X[121X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo, the element ([10XTitle[110X) is of so-called [21Xmixed content[121X: It can contain [13Xparsed
  character data[113X which does not contain further markup ([10X#PCDATA[110X) or any of the
  other  above mentioned elements. Mixed content must always have the asterisk
  qualifier  (like  in [10XTitle[110X) such that any sequence of elements (of the above
  list) and character data can be contained in a [10XTitle[110X element.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [10X%Text;[110X  parameter entity is used in all places in the DTD, where [21Xnormal
  text[121X  should  be  allowed, including lists, enumerations, and tables, but [13Xno[113X
  sectioning elements.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [10X%InnerText;[110X  parameter  entity  is used in all places in the DTD, where
  [21Xinner  text[121X  should  be  allowed. This means, that no structures like lists,
  enumerations, and tables are allowed. This is used for example in headings.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  element  may occur in the [10XBook[110X element after the [10XBibliography[110X element.
  If  it  is  present,  an  index is generated and inserted into the document.
  There  are elements in [5XGAPDoc[105X which implicitly generate index entries (e.g.,
  [10XFunc[110X  ([14X3.4-2[114X))  and  there is an element [10XIndex[110X ([14X3.5-4[114X) for explicitly adding

  [33X[0;0YA  [5XGAPDoc[105X book is divided into [13Xchapters[113X, [13Xsections[113X, and [13Xsubsections[113X. The idea
  is  of course, that a chapter consists of sections, which in turn consist of
  subsections.  However  for  the  sake  of flexibility, the rules are not too
  restrictive. Firstly, text is allowed everywhere in the body of the document
  (and  not only within sections). Secondly, the chapter level may be omitted.
  The exact rules are described below.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XAppendices[113X  are  a flavor of chapters, occurring after all regular chapters.
  There  is  a  special  type  of  subsection  called  [21X[10XManSection[110X[121X.  This  is a
  subsection  devoted to the description of a function, operation or variable.
  It is analogous to a manpage in the UNIX environment. Usually each function,
  operation, method, and so on should have its own [10XManSection[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YCross  referencing  is  done  on  the  level  of  [10XSubsection[110Xs,  respectively
  [10XManSection[110Xs.   The  topics  in  [5XGAP[105X's  online  help  are  also  pointing  to
  subsections. So, they should not be too long.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe start our description of the sectioning elements [21Xtop-down[121X:[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  [10XBody[110X  element  marks the main part of the document. It must occur after
  the  [10XTableOfContents[110X  element.  There is a big difference between [13Xinside[113X and
  [13Xoutside[113X  of  this element: Whereas regular text is allowed nearly everywhere
  in  the  [10XBody[110X element and its subelements, this is not true for the [13Xoutside[113X.
  This   has   also  implications  on  the  handling  of  whitespace.  [13XOutside[113X
  superfluous  whitespace  is usually ignored when it occurs between elements.
  [13XInside[113X  of  the  [10XBody[110X  element  whitespace matters because character data is
  allowed nearly everywhere. Here is the definition in the DTD:[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe [10XManSection[110X element can have a [10XLabel[110X attribute, such that this subsection
  can  be referenced later on with a [10XRef[110X element (see section [14X3.5-1[114X). But this
  is  probably rarely necessary because the elements [10XFunc[110X and so on (explained
  below) generate automatically labels for cross referencing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  content  of  a  [10XManSection[110X  element  is one or more elements describing
  certain items in [5XGAP[105X, each of them optionally followed by a [10XReturns[110X element,
  followed  by  a  [10XDescription[110X  element,  which  contains  [10X%Text;[110X  (see [14X3.2-3[114X)
  describing  it. (Remember to include examples in the description as often as
  possible,  see [14X3.7-10[114X).  The classes of items [5XGAPDoc[105X knows of are: functions
  ([10XFunc[110X),  operations  ([10XOper[110X),  methods  ([10XMeth[110X),  filters  ([10XFilt[110X),  properties
  ([10XProp[110X), attributes ([10XAttr[110X), variables ([10XVar[110X), families ([10XFam[110X), and info classes
  ([10XInfoClass[110X).  One [10XManSection[110X should only describe several of such items when
  these are very closely related.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach  element for an item corresponding to a [5XGAP[105X function can be followed by
  a  [10XReturns[110X  element. In output versions of the document the string [21XReturns: [121X
  will  be  put  in front of the content text. The text in the [10XReturns[110X element
  should  usually  be  a  short  hint about the type of object returned by the
  function. This is intended to give a good mnemonic for the use of a function
  (together with a good choice of names for the formal arguments).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10XManSection[110Xs are also sectioning elements which count as subsections. Usually
  there  should  be no [10XHeading[110X-element in a [10XManSection[110X, in that case a heading
  is  generated automatically from the first [10XFunc[110X-like element. Sometimes this
  default  behaviour  does  not  look  appropriate, for example when there are
  several [10XFunc[110X-like elements. For such cases an optional [10XHeading[110X is allowed.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  element  is used within a [10XManSection[110X element to specify the usage of a
  function.  The  [10XName[110X  attribute is required and its value is the name of the
  function.  The  value of the [10XArg[110X attribute (also required) contains the full
  list  of  arguments  including  optional  parts, which are denoted by square
  brackets.  The  argument names can be separated by whitespace, commas or the
  square   brackets   for   the   optional  arguments,  like  [10X"grp[, elm]"[110X  or
  [10X"xx[y[z] ]"[110X.  If [5XGAP[105X options are used, this can be followed by a colon [10X:[110X and
  one or more assignments, like [10X"n[, r]: tries := 100"[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  name  of the function is also used as label for cross referencing. When
  the  name  of  the  function  appears  in the text of the document it should
  [13Xalways[113X  be  written  with  the  [10XRef[110X element, see [14X3.5-1[114X. This allows to use a
  unique typesetting style for function names and automatic cross referencing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the optional [10XLabel[110X attribute is given, it is appended (with a colon [10X:[110X in
  between)  to  the  name  of the function for cross referencing purposes. The
  text  of  the label can also appear in the document text. So, it should be a
  kind of short explanation.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  element  automatically  produces  an  index entry with the name of the

  [33X[0;0YCross  referencing  in  the [5XGAPDoc[105X system is somewhat different to the usual

  distinguished  from  a [21Xreference to a chapter[121X. The idea of this is, that the
  markup  must  contain  this information such that the converters can produce
  better  output.  The  HTML  converter  can  for  example  typeset a function
  reference just as the name of the function with a link to the description of

  [33X[0;0YThe [10XRef[110X element is defined to be [10XEMPTY[110X. If one of the attributes [10XFunc[110X, [10XOper[110X,
  [10XMeth[110X,  [10XProp[110X,  [10XAttr[110X,  [10XVar[110X,  [10XFam[110X,  [10XInfoClass[110X, [10XChap[110X, [10XSect[110X, [10XSubsect[110X, [10XAppendix[110X is
  given  then  there must be exactly one of these, making the reference one to
  the  corresponding  object. The [10XLabel[110X attribute can be specified in addition
  to  make  the  reference  unique, for example if more than one method with a
  given name is present. (Note that there is no way to specify in the DTD that
  exactly  one  of  the  first  listed  attributes  must  be given, this is an
  additional rule.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  reference  to a [10XLabel[110X element defined below (see [14X3.5-2[114X) is done by giving
  the [10XLabel[110X attribute and optionally the [10XText[110X attribute. If the [10XText[110X attribute
  is  present  its value is typeset in place of the [10XRef[110X element, if linking is
  possible  (for example in HTML). If this is not possible, the section number
  is  typeset.  This  type  of reference is also used for references to tables
  (see [14X3.6-5[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  external  reference  into  another  book  can  be specified by using the
  [10XBookName[110X  attribute.  In  this  case  the [10XLabel[110X attribute or, if this is not
  given,  the  function  or  section  like  attribute,  is used to resolve the
  reference. The generated reference points to the first hit when asking [21X?book
  name: label[121X inside [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  optional  attribute  [10XStyle[110X can take only the values [10XText[110X and [10XNumber[110X. It
  can  be  used with references to sectioning units and it gives a hint to the
  converter programs, whether an explicit section number is generated or text.
  Normally all references to sections generate numbers and references to a [5XGAP[105X
  object  generate  the  name of the corresponding object with some additional
  link  or  sectioning  information, which is the behavior of [10XStyle="Text"[110X. In
  case [10XStyle="Number"[110X in all cases an explicit section number is generated. So[133X
