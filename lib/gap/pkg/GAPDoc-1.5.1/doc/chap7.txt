  [33X[0;0YA  standard  for collecting references (in particular to mathematical texts)
  is  BibTeX  ([7Xhttp://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/distribs/doc/[107X). A
  disadvantage  of BibTeX is that the format of the data is specified with the
  use by LaTeX in mind. The data format is less suited for conversion to other
  document types like plain text or HTML.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the first section we describe utilities for using data from BibTeX files
  in [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn the second section we introduce a new XML based data format BibXMLext for
  bibliographies  which seems better suited for other tasks than using it with
  LaTeX.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnother section will describe utilities to deal with BibXMLext data in [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X7.1 [33X[0;0YParsing BibTeX Files[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  are functions for parsing, normalizing and printing reference lists in
  BibTeX format. The reference describing this format is [Lam85, Appendix B].[133X
  
  [1X7.1-1 ParseBibFiles[101X
  
  [29X[2XParseBibFiles[102X( [3Xbibfile1[103X[, [3Xbibfile2[103X[, [3X...[103X]] ) [32X function
  [29X[2XParseBibStrings[102X( [3Xstr1[103X[, [3Xstr2[103X[, [3X...[103X]] ) [32X function
  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ylist [10X[list of bib-records, list of abbrevs, list of expansions][110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  first  function parses the files [3Xbibfile1[103X and so on (if a file does not
  exist the extension [10X.bib[110X is appended) in BibTeX format and returns a list as
  follows:  [10X[entries,  strings, texts][110X. Here [10Xentries[110X is a list of records, one
  record  for  each  reference contained in [3Xbibfile[103X. Then [10Xstrings[110X is a list of
  abbreviations  defined  by  [10X@string[110X-entries  in  [3Xbibfile[103X and [10Xtexts[110X is a list
  which  contains  in  the  corresponding  position  the full text for such an
  abbreviation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  second  function  does  the same, but the input is given as [5XGAP[105X strings
  [3Xstr1[103X and so on.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  records  in  [10Xentries[110X store key-value pairs of a BibTeX reference in the
  form  [10Xrec(key1  = value1, ...)[110X. The names of the keys are converted to lower
  case.  The type of the reference (i.e., book, article, ...) and the citation
  key are stored as components [10X.Type[110X and [10X.Label[110X. The records also have a [10X.From[110X
  field that says that the data are read from a BibTeX source.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xnamestr[103X  must  be  a string describing an author or a list of
  authors as described in the BibTeX documentation in [Lam85, Appendix B 1.2].
  The  function  [2XNormalizedNameAndKey[102X  returns a list of the form [ normalized
  name  string,  short  key,  long  key, names as lists]. The first entry is a
  normalized form of the input where names are written as [21Xlastname, first name
  initials[121X.  The second and third entry are the name parts of a short and long
  key  for  the  bibliography entry, formed from the (initials of) last names.
  The  fourth  entry  is  a  list of lists, one for each name, where a name is
  described  by  three  strings for the last name, the first name initials and
  the first name(s) as given in the input.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  determination of the initials is limited to names where the
  first  letter  is described by a single character (and does not contain some
  markup, say for accents).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function  [2XNormalizeNameAndKey[102X  gets  as  argument  [3Xr[103X  a  record  for  a
  bibliography  entry  as  returned  by  [2XParseBibFiles[102X ([14X7.1-1[114X). It substitutes
  [10X.author[110X  and  [10X.editor[110X  fields  of  [3Xr[103X  by their normalized form, the original
  versions are stored in fields [10X.authororig[110X and [10X.editororig[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore  a  short  and  a  long  citation key is generated and stored in

  it by setting the level of [2XInfoBibTools[102X to 0. With level 2 there may be some
  more information for debugging purposes.[133X
  
  
  [1X7.2 [33X[0;0YThe BibXMLext Format[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YBibliographical  data  in BibTeX files have the disadvantage that the actual
  data  are given in LaTeX syntax. This makes it difficult to use the data for
  anything but for LaTeX, say for representations of the data as plain text or
  HTML.  For  example:  mathematical  formulae  are  in  LaTeX [10X$[110X environments,
  non-ASCII  characters  can  be  specified  in  many strange ways, and how to
  specify URLs for links if the output format allows them?[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  we propose an XML data format for bibliographical data which addresses
  these problems, it is called BibXMLext. In the next section we describe some
  tools  for  generating  (an  approximation  to) this data format from BibTeX
  data, and for using data given in BibXMLext format for various purposes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   first   motivation   for   this   development   was  the  handling  of
  bibliographical  data  in [5XGAPDoc[105X, but the format and the tools are certainly
  useful for other purposes as well.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  started  from  a  DTD  [11Xbibxml.dtd[111X  which is publicly available, say from
  [7Xhttp://bibtexml.sf.net/[107X.   This   is  essentially  a  reformulation  of  the
  definition  of  the  BibTeX  format,  including  several of some widely used
  further fields. This has already the advantage that a generic XML parser can
  check  the  validity of the data entries, for example for missing compulsary
  fields in entries. We applied the following changes and extensions to define
  the  DTD  for BibXMLext, stored in the file [11Xbibxmlext.dtd[111X which can be found
  in the root directory of this [5XGAPDoc[105X package (and in Appendix [14XC[114X):[133X
  
  [8Xnames[108X
        [33X[0;6YLists of names in the [10Xauthor[110X and [10Xeditor[110X fields in BibTeX are difficult
        to  parse.  Here  they  must be given by a sequence of [10X<name>[110X-elements
        which  each  contain an optional [10X<first>[110X- and a [10X<last>[110X-element for the
        first and last names, respectively.[133X
  
  [8X[10X<M>[110X and [10X<Math>[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThese  elements  enclose  mathematical  formulae, the content is LaTeX
        code  (without  the [10X$[110X). These should be handled in the same way as the
        elements  with  the  same  names  in  [5XGAPDoc[105X,  see [14X3.8-2[114X and [14X3.8-1[114X. In
        particular,  simple  formulae  which  have  a  well defined plain text
        representation can be given in [10X<M>[110X-elements.[133X
  
  [8XEncoding[108X
        [33X[0;6YNote  that  in  XML  files  we  can  use  the  full  range  of unicode
        characters,  see  [7Xhttp://www.unicode.org/[107X.  All  non-ASCII  characters
        should  be  specified  as  unicode characters. This makes dealing with
        special  characters  easy  for  plain  text or HTML, only for use with
        LaTeX some sort of translation is necessary.[133X
  
  [8X[10X<URL>[110X[108X
        [33X[0;6YThese  elements  are  allowed  everywhere  in  the  text and should be
        represented by links in converted formats which allow this. It is used
        in  the  same  way  as  the  element with the same name in [5XGAPDoc[105X, see

        [10X<Alt>[110X-elements with the same definition as in [5XGAPDoc[105X, see [14X3.9-1[114X.[133X

  the  BibTeX  documentation  on  how the standard fields of entries should be
  used.  Which entry types and which fields are supported (and the ordering of
  the  fields  which  is  fixed  by  a DTD) can be either read off the DTD, or
  within [5XGAP[105X one can use the function [2XTemplateBibXML[102X ([14X7.3-10[114X) to get templates

  [33X[0;0YThere  are  three  possibilities  to specify the bibliography entries in the

  other  two lists are assumed to be empty. To all entries of the (first) list
  the  function [2XStringBibAsXMLext[102X ([14X7.3-3[114X) is applied and the resulting strings
  are written to the result file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  third  possibility is that [3Xbib[103X is a record in the format as returned by

  the  entries  for  the  BibXMLext  file  are  produced with [2XStringXMLElement[102X
  ([14X5.2-2[114X), and if [3Xbib[103X[10X.entities[110X is bound then it is tried to resubstitute parts

  [33X[0;0YFor  working with BibXMLext entries we find it convenient to first translate
  the parse tree of an entry, as returned by [2XParseBibXMLextFiles[102X ([14X7.3-4[114X), to a
  record  with  the  field names of the entry as components whose value is the
  content  of the field as string. These strings are generated with respect to
  a result type. The records are generated by the following function which can
  be customized by the user.[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ya record with fields as strings[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  function  generates  a content string for each field of a bibliography
  entry  and assigns them to record components. This content may depend on the
  requested result type and possibly some given options.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  arguments are as follows: [3Xentry[103X is the parse tree of an [10X<entry>[110X element
  as  returned by [2XParseBibXMLextString[102X ([14X7.3-4[114X) or [2XParseBibXMLextFiles[102X ([14X7.3-4[114X).
  The optional argument [3Xrestype[103X describes the type of the result. This package
  supports  currently  the  types  [10X"BibTeX"[110X, [10X"Text"[110X and [10X"HTML"[110X. The default is
  [10X"BibTeX"[110X. The optional argument [3Xstrings[103X must be a list of key-value pairs as
  returned  in  the  component  [10X.strings[110X in the result of [2XParseBibXMLextString[102X
  ([14X7.3-4[114X). The argument [3Xoptions[103X must be a record.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the  entry  contains an [10Xauthor[110X field then the result will also contain a
  component  [10X.authorAsList[110X  which  is a list containing for each author a list
  with  three entries of the form [10X[last name, first name initials, first name][110X
  (the  third  entry means the first name as given in the data). Similarly, an
  [10Xeditor[110X field is accompanied by a component [10X.editorAsList[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe following [3Xoptions[103X are currently supported.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf [10Xoptions.fullname[110X is bound and set to [9Xtrue[109X then the full given first names
  for  authors and editors will be used, the default is to use the initials of
  the  first  names.  Also,  if [10Xoptions.namefirstlast[110X is bound and set to [9Xtrue[109X
  then  the names are written in the form [21Xfirst-name(s) last-name[121X, the default
  is the form [21Xlast-name, first-name(s)[121X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf [10Xoptions.href[110X is bound and set to [9Xfalse[109X then the [10X"BibTeX"[110X type result will
  not  use  [10X\href[110X  commands.  The  default  is  to produce [10X\href[110X commands from
  [10X<URL>[110X-elements  such  that LaTeX with the [10Xhyperref[110X package can produce links
  for them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  content  of an [10X<Alt>[110X-element with [10XOnly[110X-attribute is included if [3Xrestype[103X
  is given in the attribute and ignored otherwise, and vice versa in case of a
  [10XNot[110X-attribute.  If  [10Xoptions.useAlt[110X is bound, it must be a list of strings to
  which  [3Xrestype[103X  is  added.  Then  an  [10X<Alt>[110X-element  with  [10XOnly[110X-attribute is
  evaluated  if  the intersection of [10Xoptions.useAlt[110X and the types given in the
  attribute  is not empty. In case of a [10XNot[110X-attribute the element is evaluated
  if this intersection is empty.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [3Xrestype[103X is [10X"BibTeX"[110X then the string fields in the result will be recoded
  with  [2XEncode[102X  ([14X6.2-2[114X) and target [10X"LaTeX"[110X. If [10Xoptions.hasLaTeXmarkup[110X is bound
  and  set  to  [9Xtrue[109X  (for  example, because the data are originally read from
  BibTeX files), then the target [10X"LaTeXleavemarkup"[110X will be used.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[3Xrestype[103X  is  a  string  describing  the result type for which the handler is
  installed, see [2XRecBibXMLEntry[102X ([14X7.3-7[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  both  arguments,  [3Xelementname[103X  and [3Xrestype[103X, it is also possible to give
  lists of the described ones for installing several handler at once.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  argument  [3Xhandler[103X  must  be  a function with five arguments of the form
  [3Xhandler[103X[10X(entry,  r, restype, strings, options)[110X. Here [3Xentry[103X is a parse tree of
  a  BibXMLext  [10X<entry>[110X-element,  [3Xr[103X  is  a  node  in  this tree for an element
  [3Xelementname[103X,   and   [3Xrestype[103X,  [3Xstrings[103X  and  [3Xoptions[103X  are  as  explained  in
  [2XRecBibXMLEntry[102X ([14X7.3-7[114X). The function should return a string representing the
  content  of  the  node  [3Xr[103X.  If  [3Xelementname[103X is of the form [10X"Wrap:myname"[110X the
  handler is used for elements of form [10X<Wrap Name="myname">...</Wrap>[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [3Xelementname[103X  is  [10X"Finish"[110X the handler should look like above except that
  now  [3Xr[103X  is  the record generated by [2XRecBibXMLEntry[102X ([14X7.3-7[114X) just before it is
  returned.  Here  the  handler  should  return  nothing.  It  can  be used to
  manipulate  the  record  [3Xr[103X,  for  example  for  changing the encoding of the
  strings or for adding some more components.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  installed  handler  is called by [10XBuildRecBibXMLEntry([110X[3Xentry[103X, [3Xr[103X, [3Xrestype[103X,
  [3Xstrings[103X,  [3Xoptions[103X[10X)[110X.  The  string  for the whole content of an element can be
  generated   by   [10XContentBuildRecBibXMLEntry([110X[3Xentry[103X,   [3Xr[103X,   [3Xrestype[103X,  [3Xstrings[103X,

  [33X[0;0YThe  format  of  a  [10X.Year[110X  component  can  be  either  a  four digit number,
