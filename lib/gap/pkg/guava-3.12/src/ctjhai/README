******************************************************************

This directory contains the source code for computing the minimum
Hamming weight of linear codes over GF(2) and GF(3). The executable
minimum-weight is called within GUAVA by the MinimumWeight function.

This code is known to run in the following platforms:
   o X11 under Mac OS X (PowerPC) - 32 bit machine
   o Windows XP running Cygwin - 32 bit machine
   o Linux 2.6 - 32 bit machine
   o Linux 2.6 - 64 bit machine

You can also use this executable without having to launch GUAVA.
This code expects a generator matrix as an input and the format of
the matrix may be easily explained with this example.

6 12 3
1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 1

The above example is the generator matrix of a code of length 12
and dimension 6 over GF(3). To compute the minimum Hamming weight
of the code above, you can use the following command:

    minimum-weight GeneratorMatrix.File

where GeneratorMatrix.File contains the generator matrix described
above. For further information on the other parameters, run

    minimum-weight --help

To produce the executable, refer to the Makefile in GUAVA's main
directory.
