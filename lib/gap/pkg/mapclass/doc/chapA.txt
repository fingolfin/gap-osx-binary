  To  Install  the  package place the "MapClass" folder into your GAP system's
  'pkg'  directory.  If  you  do not have permission to modify the gap package
  then  the  package  can  be included by appending a local directory to GAP's
  root  directory  using  the  '-l'  flag.  For more information on GAP's root
  directory  process  try '?GAP root' in a GAP session. Or see the online help
  at http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/htm/ref/CHAP009.htm#SECT002 To Load
  the  package  simply  type  'LoadPackage("mapclass");'. If the load has been
  successful the package banner will be shown.
