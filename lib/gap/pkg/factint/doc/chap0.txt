  [1XAbstract[0m
  This  package  for  [5XGAP[0mÂ 4  provides  a general-purpose integer factorization
  routine,  which  makes  use  of  a  combination  of  factoring  methods.  In
  particular it contains implementations of the following algorithms:
  
  --    Pollard's p-1
  
  --    Williams' p+1
  
  --    Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
  
  --    Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
  
  --    Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)
  
  It  also  contains code by Frank LÃ¼beck for making use of Richard P. Brent's
  tables  of  factors  of integers of the form b^k pm 1. [5XFactInt[0m is completely
  written in the [5XGAP[0m language and contains / requires no external binaries. It
  needs  [5XGAPDoc[0mÂ 1.0  [LN07]  or  higher.  [5XFactInt[0m must be installed in the [11Xpkg[0m
  subdirectory of the [5XGAP[0m distribution.
