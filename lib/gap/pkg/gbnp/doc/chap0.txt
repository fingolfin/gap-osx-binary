  [1XAbstract[0m
  We  provide  algorithms,  written  in  the  [5XGAP[0m  4 programming language, for
  computing Gr√∂bner bases of non-commutative polynomials, and some variations,
  such  as  a  weighted  and  truncated  version  and  a  tracing facility. In
  addition,   there   are   algorithms   for   analyzing  the  quotient  of  a
  non-commutative  polynomial algebra by a 2-sided ideal generated by a set of
  polynomials  whose  Gr√∂bner  basis  has  been  determined  and for computing
  quotient modules of free modules over quotient algebras.
  
  The notion of algorithm is interpreted loosely: in general one cannot expect
  a  non-commutative  Gr√∂bner  basis algorithm to terminate, as it would imply
  solvability of the word problem for finitely presented (semi)groups.
  
  This  documentation  gives  a short description of the mathematical content,
  explains  the functions of the package, and provides more than twenty worked
  out examples.

  [1XAcknowledgements[0m
  --    The package is based on an earlier version by Rosane Ushirobira.
  
  --    The  bulk  of  the  package  is written by Arjeh M. Cohen and Di√© A.H.
        Gijsbers.
  
  --    The  theory  is  mainly  taken from literature by Teo Mora [Mor94] and
        Edward L. Green [Gre99].
  
  --    From   Version  0.8.3  on  the  package  has  three  additional  files
        ([11Xfincheck.g[0m,  [11Xtree.g[0m  [11Xgraphs.g[0m)  with routines for finding the Hilbert
        function  and testing finite dimensionality when given a Gr√∂bner basis
        by Chris Krook [Kro03], based on work by Victor Ufnarovski [Ufn89].
  
  --    From  Version  0.9  on the package is enriched with support for fields
        implemented  in  GAP and additional prefix rules for quotient modules,
        as  well as some speed improvements by Jan Willem Knopper. Knopper has
        also formatted the documentation in GAPDoc [LN06].
  
  --    From   Version   1.0   on  the  package  is  extended  with  NMO  (for
        Noncommutative  Monomial  Orderings) by Randall Cone. This enables the
        GBNP  user  to choose a wider selection of monomial orderings than the
        standard one built into GBNP itself. Documentation on NMO can be found
        in the NMO manual [Con10].
