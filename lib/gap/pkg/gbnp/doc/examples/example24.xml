In Serre's book <Cite Key="MR1954121"/> the following exercise can be found: 
Prove  that the group
<M> \langle \{a,b,c\}\mid \{ bab^{-1}a^{-2}, cbc^{-1}b^{-2}, aca^{-1}c^{-2}\}\right\rangle</M>
is the trivial group.
Here we solve the exercise by running the trace variant of the 
Gröbner basis function with input the set of equations
<M>ba - a^2 b, cb - b^2c, ac - c^2a</M>
together with relations forcing that <M>a,b,c</M> are invertible
with inverse <M>A,B,C</M>.

We use <Ref Func="SGrobnerTrace" Style="Text"/>,
the trace variant of the Gröbner basis computation,

The dimension of the quotient algebra is 1, showing that the group algebra
is 1-dimensional. This implies that the group with the above presentation
is trivial.

Since the output is large and might spoil the exercise, 
we confine ourselves to
the printing first polynomial <C>GB[1]</C> and the length of its trace.
As the trace polynomial expresses 
<C>GB[1]</C>, which is equal to <M>a-1</M>, as a combination of the binomials
in <C>KI</C>, it gives a proof that <M>a</M> can be rewritten within the
group to the trivial element. It is easy to derive from this that
<M>b</M> and <M>c</M> are also trivial in the group.
This justifies the restriction to <C>GB[1]</C>.
