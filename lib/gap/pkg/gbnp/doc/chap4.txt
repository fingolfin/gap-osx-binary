  [1X4.1 Introduction[0X
  
  Many  functions  of  the  GBNP  package  can produce additional output. Such
  output  might  be useful for long calculations, to see where the calculation
  is or to gain more information about the calculation itself.
  
  [5XGAP[0m  provides  the tools to be able to tune the output of the functions. All
  of the functions of this package use the [10XInfoClass[0m [2XInfoGBNP[0m ([14X4.2-1[0m) and some
  use  the [10XInfoClass[0m [2XInfoGBNPTime[0m ([14X4.3-1[0m). As usual with GAP when this is left
  at  0, the functions will hardly print additional information. It can be set
  to  1  or  2  with  [10XSetInfoLevel[0m  (more  about this function can be found at
  [14XReference:  SetInfoLevel[0m).  A brief explanation about each infolevel will be
  given in the next sections.
  
  
  [1X4.2 InfoGBNP[0X
  
  [1X4.2-1 InfoGBNP[0m
  
  [2X> InfoGBNP________________________________________________________[0Xinfo class
  
  The  [10XInfoClass[0m  for  this package is used in almost all functions. To change
  this  level to 1 (some information) or 2 (more information, also information
  from calculation loops) use the function [10XSetInfoLevel[0m.
  
  
  [1X4.2-2 What will be printed at level 0[0X
  
  At  level  0  no  information  is  printed  beyond what functions themselves
  command  to  be  printed.  These  include  functions  like  [2XPrintNP[0m ([14X3.2-1[0m),
  [2XPrintNPList[0m  ([14X3.2-3[0m),  [2XPrintTraceList[0m  ([14X3.7-2[0m) and [2XPrintNPListTrace[0m ([14X3.7-4[0m),
  but  it  also  includes  the  function [2XDetermineGrowthQA[0m ([14X3.6-1[0m), which only
  prints  one  or two lines and [2XDimsQATrunc[0m ([14X3.8-5[0m) which produces information
  about a truncated Gr√∂bner basis.
  
  
  [1X4.2-3 What will be printed at level 1[0X
  
  The infolevel can be set to 1 with the following command:
  
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
    [4XSetInfoLevel(InfoGBNP,1);[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  At  level  1  a large set of functions will produce a bit of output. Most of
  this  information reports on the phase of the algorithm the calculations are
  in or some simple statistics about the input or output.
  
  
  [1X4.2-4 What will be printed at level 2[0X
  
  The infolevel can be set to 2 with the following command.
  
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
    [4XSetInfoLevel(InfoGBNP,2);[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  At  level  2  a  large  set  of functions will produce a lot of output. This
  mostly concerns information on loops in the calculations. Timing information
  will be printed as well.
  
  
  [1X4.3 InfoGBNPTime[0X
  
  [1X4.3-1 InfoGBNPTime[0m
  
  [2X> InfoGBNPTime____________________________________________________[0Xinfo class
  
  The  [10XInfoClass[0m for timing is used in producing information about the runtime
  of the algorithm in certain possibly lengthy calculations.
  
  To  change  this  level to 1 (Gr√∂bner functions give information) or 2 (more
  information,  also  information from other functions, which might not always
  take a long time and from inside loops) use the function [10XSetInfoLevel[0m.
  
  
  [1X4.3-2 What will be printed at level 0[0X
  
  No  timing information will be printed at level 0. This can be desirable for
  small examples or when producing test output, for use with [10XReadTest[0m.
  
  
  [1X4.3-3 What will be printed at level 1[0X
  
  The infolevel can be set to 1 with the following command:
  
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
    [4XSetInfoLevel(InfoGBNPTime,1);[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  At  level  one  there will be time information printed by the functions from
  different variants of the Gr√∂bner basis algorithm: [2XGrobner[0m ([14X3.4-1[0m), [2XSGrobner[0m
  ([14X3.4-2[0m), [2XSGrobnerTrace[0m ([14X3.7-5[0m), and [2XSGrobnerTrunc[0m ([14X3.8-2[0m).
  
  
  [1X4.3-4 What will be printed at level 2[0X
  
  The infolevel can be set to 2 with the following command:
  
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
    [4XSetInfoLevel(InfoGBNPTime,2);[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  At  level  two  there will also be some information printed from a loop from
  within [2XSGrobnerTrunc[0m ([14X3.8-2[0m).
