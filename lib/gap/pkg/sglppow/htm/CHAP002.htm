<h1>2 Accessing the data</h1><p>
<p>
When this package is loaded, then the groups of order <var>3<sup>8</sup></var> and <var>p<sup>7</sup></var> for 
<var>p &gt; 11</var> are additionally available via the SmallGroups library. As a result,
all groups of order <var>p<sup>n</sup></var> with <var>p=2</var> and <var>n &le;9</var> and <var>p=3</var> and <var>n &le;8</var>
and <var>p</var> arbitrary and <var>n &le;7</var> are then available via the small groups
library. The corresponding information can be obtained via 
<p>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>SmallGroup(size, number)</code>
<p>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>NumberSmallGroups(size)</code>
<p>
<a name = ""></a>
<li><code>SmallGroupsInformation(size)</code>
<p>
There is no IdGroup function available for this extension of the small
groups library.
<p>
WARNING: The user should be aware that there are there are 1,396,077 groups
of order <var>3<sup>8</sup></var>, 1,600,573 groups of order <var>13<sup>7</sup></var>, and 5,546,909 groups
of order <var>17<sup>7</sup></var>. For general <var>p</var> the number of groups of order <var>p<sup>7</sup></var> is 
of order <var>3p<sup>5</sup></var>. Furthermore as <var>p</var> increases, the time taken to
generate a complete list of the groups of order <var>p<sup>7</sup></var> grows rapidly.
For <var>p=13</var> it
takes several hours to generate the complete list. For <var>p&le;11</var> the
groups are precomputed, and their SmallGroup codes are stored in the
SmallGroups database. For <var>p&gt;11</var> the Lie rings have to be generated from
4773 parametrized presentations in the LiePRing database, and then converted
into groups using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. A complete list of 
power commutator presentations for the groups of order <var>13<sup>7</sup></var> takes over 
11 gb of memory.
