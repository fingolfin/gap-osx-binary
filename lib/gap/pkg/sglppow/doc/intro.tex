\Chapter{Introduction}

SglPPow is a package which extends the Small Groups Library. Currently the 
Small Groups Library gives access to the following groups:

\beginitems
<(1)> & Those of order at most 2000 except 1024 (423,164,062 groups);

<(2)> & Those of cubefree order at most 50,000 (395,703 groups);

<(3)> & Those of order $p^{7}$ for the primes $p=3,5,7,11$ (907,489 groups);

<(4)> & Those of order $p^{n}$ for $n\leq 6$ and all primes $p$;

<(5)> & Those of order $pq^{n}$ where $q^{n}$ divides 28, 36, 55 or 74 and 
     $p$ is an arbitrary prime not equal to $q$;

<(6)> & Those of squarefree order;

<(7)> & Those whose order factorizes into at most 3 primes.
\enditems

This package gives access to the groups of order $p^{7}$ for $p>11$, and to
the groups of order $3^{8}$.

To access the groups of order $p^{7}$ for $p>11$ you need Bettina Eick and
Michael Vaughan-Lee's package LiePRing, and Willem de Graaf and Serena 
Cicalos's package LieRing. 

The groups of order $3^{8}$ have been determined by Michael Vaughan-Lee.
The groups of order $p^{7}$ for $p>11$ are available via Bettina Eick and 
Michael Vaughan-Lee's database of the nilpotent Lie rings of order $p^{k}$ 
for $k\leq 7$, $p>3$. These groups are obtained from the Lie rings using 
the implementation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in the LieRing
package.
