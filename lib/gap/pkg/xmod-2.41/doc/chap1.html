<p>The term crossed module was introduced by J. H. C. Whitehead in <a href="chapBib.html#biBW2">[Whi48]</a>, <a href="chapBib.html#biBW1">[Whi49]</a>. Loday, in <a href="chapBib.html#biBL1">[Lod82]</a>, reformulated the notion of a crossed module as a cat1-group. Norrie <a href="chapBib.html#biBN1">[Nor90]</a>, <a href="chapBib.html#biBN2">[Nor87]</a> and Gilbert <a href="chapBib.html#biBG1">[Gil90]</a> have studied derivations, automorphisms of crossed modules and the actor of a crossed module, while Ellis <a href="chapBib.html#biBE1">[Ell84]</a> has investigated higher dimensional analogues. Properties of induced crossed modules have been determined by Brown, Higgins and Wensley in <a href="chapBib.html#biBBH1">[BH78]</a>, <a href="chapBib.html#biBBW1">[BW95]</a> and <a href="chapBib.html#biBBW2">[BW96]</a>. For further references see <a href="chapBib.html#biBAW1">[AW00]</a>, where we discuss some of the data structures and algorithms used in this package, and also tabulate isomorphism classes of cat1-groups up to size <span class="SimpleMath">30</span>.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">XMod</strong> was originally implemented in 1997 using the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 3 language. In April 2002 the first and third parts were converted to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4, the pre-structures were added, and version 2.001 was released. The final two parts, covering derivations, sections and actors, were included in the January 2004 release 2.002 for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.4.</p>

<p>Many of the function names have been changed during the conversion, for example <code class="code">ConjugationXMod</code> has become <code class="code">XModByNormalSubgroup</code>. For a list of name changes see the file <code class="file">names.pdf</code> in the <code class="file">doc</code> directory.</p>

<p>The current versions are 2.22 for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.6, released on January 25th 2013; and 2.41 for <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4.7, released on 5th June 2015.</p>

<p>The package may be obtained as a compressed tar file <code class="file">xmod-2.41.tar.gz</code> by ftp from one of the sites with a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4 archive, or from the Bangor Mathematics website pages using the URL: <span class="URL"><a href="http://www.maths.bangor.ac.uk/chda/gap4/xmod/xmod241.html">http://www.maths.bangor.ac.uk/chda/gap4/xmod/xmod241.html</a></span></p>

<p>Crossed modules and cat1-groups are special types of <em>2-dimensional groups</em> <a href="chapBib.html#biBB82">[Bro82]</a>, <a href="chapBib.html#biBbrow:hig:siv">[BHS11]</a>, and are implemented as <code class="code">2dDomains</code> and <code class="code">2dGroups</code> having a <code class="code">Source</code> and a <code class="code">Range</code>.</p>

<p>The package divides into four parts. The first part is concerned with the standard constructions for pre-crossed modules and crossed modules; together with direct products; normal sub-crossed modules; and quotients. Operations for constructing pre-cat1-groups and cat1-groups, and for converting between cat1-groups and crossed modules, are also included.</p>

<p>The second part is concerned with <em>morphisms</em> of (pre-)crossed modules and (pre-)cat1-groups, together with standard operations for morphisms, such as composition, image and kernel.</p>

<p>The third part deals with the equivalent notions of <em>derivation</em> for a crossed module and <em>section</em> for a cat1-group, and the monoids which they form under the Whitehead multiplication.</p>

<p>The fourth part deals with actor crossed modules and actor cat1-groups. For the actor crossed module <span class="SimpleMath">Act(mathcalX)</span> of a crossed module <span class="SimpleMath">mathcalX</span> we require representations for the Whitehead group of regular derivations of <span class="SimpleMath">mathcalX</span> and for the group of automorphisms of <span class="SimpleMath">mathcalX</span>. The construction also provides an inner morphism from <span class="SimpleMath">mathcalX</span> to <span class="SimpleMath">Act(mathcalX)</span> whose kernel is the centre of <span class="SimpleMath">mathcalX</span>.</p>

<p>Since version 2.007 there are experimental functions for <em>crossed squares</em> and their morphisms, structures which arise as <span class="SimpleMath">3</span>-dimensional groups. Examples of these are inclusions of normal sub-crossed modules, and the inner morphism from a crossed module to its actor.</p>

<p>Future plans include the implementation of <em>group-graphs</em> which will provide examples of pre-crossed modules (their implementation will require interaction with graph-theoretic functions in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> 4). Cat2-groups, and conversion betwen these and crossed squares, are also planned.</p>

<p>The equivalent categories <code class="code">XMod</code> (crossed modules) and <code class="code">Cat1</code> (cat1-groups) are also equivalent to <code class="code">GpGpd</code>, the subcategory of group objects in the category <code class="code">Gpd</code> of groupoids. Finite groupoids have been implemented in Emma Moore's package <strong class="pkg">Gpd</strong> <a href="chapBib.html#biBM1">[Moo01]</a> for groupoids and crossed resolutions.</p>

<p>In order that the user has some control of the verbosity of the <strong class="pkg">XMod</strong> package's functions, an <code class="code">InfoClass</code> <code class="code">InfoXMod</code> is provided (see Chapter <code class="code">ref:Info Functions</code> in the <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> Reference Manual for a description of the <code class="code">Info</code> mechanism). By default, the <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> of <code class="code">InfoXMod</code> is <code class="code">0</code>; progressively more information is supplied by raising the <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> to <code class="code">1</code>, <code class="code">2</code> and <code class="code">3</code>.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">SetInfoLevel( InfoXMod, 1); #sets the InfoXMod level to 1</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Once the package is loaded, it is possible to check the correct installation by running the test suite of the package with the following command.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">ReadPackage( "xmod", "tst/testall.g" );</span>
+ Testing examples in Chapter 2 of the XMod manual
...
