  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is the goal of the [5XConvex[105X[101X[1X package?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XConvex[105X provides structures and algorithms for convex geometry. It can handle
  convex, fans and polytopes. Not only the structures are provided, but also a
  collection  of  algorithms  to  handle those objects. Basically, it provides
  convex geometry to [5XGAP[105X. It is capable of communicating with the CAS polymake
  via  the  package  [5XPolymakeInterface[105X  and  also  provides several methods by
  itself.[133X
