<Heading>What is the goal of the &Convex; package?</Heading>
&Convex; provides structures and algorithms for convex geometry. It can handle convex, fans and polytopes. Not only the structures are provided, but also a collection of
algorithms to handle those objects. Basically, it provides convex geometry to &GAP;.
It is capable of communicating with the CAS polymake via the package &PolymakeInterface; and also provides several methods by itself.
