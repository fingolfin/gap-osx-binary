===============
 Version 0.6.8  (24/02/14)
===============

  - replaced NilpotencyRank by NilpotencyDegree

    and 2 as f.p. semigroups
  - further adjustments to GAP 4.7 and the new package Semigroups

===============
 Version 0.6.7  (07/06/13)
===============

  - a minor release fixing some bugs in the references in the documentation,
    and moving some declarations of properties and associated true methods to 
    the GAP library to avoid clashes with the forthcoming Semigroups package. 
  - Smallsemi now requires GAP 4.7

===============
 Version 0.6.6  (24/04/13)
===============

  - added starred Green's relations
  - fixed the swap of L- and R-classes  
  - fixed bug in D-class computation when MinimalGeneratingSet is known

===============
