  [33X[0;0YThe idea in what concerns the colors is the following: the reader is free to
  choose  his  colors  (taking  into  account that the latex [5Xxcolor[105X package is
  used),  but  we  try  to  make  users life reasonably easy. He is allowed to
  choose tones. The default colors used by [5XIntPic[105X are not many, although (from
  our experience) sufficient for most examples.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThese  are the [5XIntPic[105X default colors. Although the user is free to use other
  colors,  we  warn that there is a need of compatibility with the colors used
  in  other  packages  (the  LaTeX  [5Xxcolor[105X,  for  instance).  To emphasize the
  integers  of  some  sets  by using some of the colors in some list of colors
  (for  instance  the default colors) one may use empty lists to force the non
  usage  of the colors whose order in the list of colors is the order of these
  empty lists in the array of integers to be emphasized.[133X
