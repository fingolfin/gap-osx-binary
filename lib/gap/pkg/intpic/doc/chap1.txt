  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YOverview and Introduction[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XIntPic[105X  package  has as its main goal producing [10XTikz[110X code for arrays of
  integers  to  be included in a LaTeX file, which can then be processed. Some
  of the integers are emphasized, by using different colors for the cells.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XIntPic[105X  grew  up  from  my  will  to  have  a pictorial view of some sets of
  integers.  I  wanted,  in  particular,  get  a pictorial view of the results
  produced  by the [5XNumericalSgps[105X package [DGM13]. Effort has then been made to
  serve  a  slightly  more general purpose. For instance, if the user wants to
  have  a pictorial idea of how many primes there are between 800 and 1000, or
  show  it  to  his  students  and, perhaps, which among these primes are twin
  primes, he will probably be happy by producing a picture like the following[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt has clearly too much information, given through the different colors. The
  twin  primes  in the given range are in red-blue, while the remaining primes
  in the same range are in red.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package contains relatively few lines of code. The heavier part is the
  documentation, where many examples are presented.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  design  of  this  greatly benefits from my long experience on producing
  visualization  tools  for  [5XGAP[105X  objects.  The  package  [5Xsgpviz[105X [DM08] is the
  visible  part.  More recently, I got involved in a more general project, the
  [5XViz[105X  package  [DEMP12]. The experience gained there, especially through long
  and fruitful discussions with J. Mitchell, influenced me a lot. This package
  will  probably  be  part  of that more general project. For the moment it is
  independent,  but its use in conjunction with the [5XViz[105X package is recommended
  since in this case an immediate visualization is provided.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  produces  [10Xtikz[110X code that the user may then use at his wish. In
  particular,  he  can  use it in publications. But prior to obtaining results
  that  lead  to  a  publication, the user may benefit of viewing thousands of
  images.  There  is  a  (almost platform independent) function in [5XViz[105X that is
  intended  to make this task easy. It benefits from the [5XGAP[105X stuff on creating
  a  temporary  directory  where  the computations occur. The cleaning task is
  also  left  to [5XGAP[105X, which leaves the user free of the need of collecting the
  garbage.  In  order  to  produce  the drawings, LaTeX, as well as some LaTeX
  packages,  in particular [10Xtikz[110X and [10Xpgf[110X, must be installed and working. I will
  assume  that this is the case. All the images in [DFGL13] have been produced
  by using the [5XIntPic[105X package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package consists basically of a function with many options associated.
  The  purpose  of  the  manual  is to illustrate the use of the options. Many
  examples  are  presented.  A  file,  named [11Xexamples.g[111X contains the [5XGAP[105X code,
  including  the  one  to  save  the [10Xtikz[110X code, to produce the examples in the
  manual.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIn this section we give a brief description of how to start using [5XIntPic[105X. If
  you have any problems getting [5XIntPic[105X working, then you could try emailing me
  at [7Xmailto:mdelgado@fc.up.pt[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt is assumed that you have a working copy of [5XGAP[105X with version number 4.5 or
  higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  [5XGAP[105X  and instructions on how to
  install    it    can    be   obtained   from   the   main   [5XGAP[105X   web   page
  [7Xhttp://www.gap-system.org[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the  [5XIntPic[105X  package was obtained as a part of the [5XGAP[105X distribution from
  the  [21XDownload[121X  section  of  the [5XGAP[105X website, you may proceed to Section [14X1.3[114X.
  Alternatively, the [5XIntPic[105X package may be installed using a separate archive,
  for example, for an update or an installation in a non-default location (see
  [14X'Reference: GAP Root Directories'[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBelow we describe the installation procedure for the [11X.tar.gz[111X archive format,
  which   can  be  obtained  from  [7Xhttp://cmup.fc.up.pt/cmup/mdelgado/intpic/[107X.
  Installation  using  other  archive  formats  or  non  UNIX-like  systems is
  performed in a similar way.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  install the [5XIntPic[105X package, unpack the archive file, which should have a
  name of the form [10X intpic-[3XXXX[103X[10X.tar.gz [110X for some version number [3XXXX[103X, by typing[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YÂ Â  [10X gzip -dc intpic-[3XXXX[103X[10X.tar.gz | tar xpv [110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt may be unpacked in one of the following locations:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yin the [11Xpkg[111X directory of your [5XGAP[105X installation;[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yor  in  a directory named [11X.gap/pkg[111X in your home directory (to be added
        to the [5XGAP[105X root directory unless [5XGAP[105X is started with [10X-r[110X option);[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yor  in  a  directory  named  [11Xpkg[111X  in  another directory of your choice
        (e.g.Â in the directory [11Xmygap[111X in your home directory).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the  latter  case  one  must  start [5XGAP[105X with the [10X-l[110X option, e.g.Â if your
  private  [11Xpkg[111X directory is a subdirectory of [11Xmygap[111X in your home directory you
  might type:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YÂ Â  [10X gap -l "[3X;myhomedir[103X[10X/mygap" [110X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Ywhere [3Xmyhomedir[103X is the path to your home directory, which may be replaced by
  a  tilde  (the  empty  path before the semicolon is filled in by the default
  path of the [5XGAP[105X home directory).[133X

  [33X[0;0YTo use the [5XIntPic[105X Package you have to request it explicitly. This is done by
  calling [2XLoadPackage[102X ([14XReference: LoadPackage[114X):[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  package  banner,  followed by [10Xtrue[110X, will be shown, if the load has been
  successful.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  want  to  load  the  [5XIntPic[105X  package  by  default,  you can put the
  [10XLoadPackage[110X  command  into  your  [11Xgaprc[111X  file  (see  SectionÂ [14X'Reference: The
  gap.ini and gaprc files'[114X).[133X
