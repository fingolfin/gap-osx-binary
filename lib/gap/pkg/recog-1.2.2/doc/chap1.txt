  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YOverview over this manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X2[114X  describes  the installation of this package. Chapter [14X'recogbase:
  Recognition  info  records'[114X  describes the generic, recursive procedure used
  for  group  recognition  throughout  this  package.  At  the  heart  of this
  procedure  is  the  definition  of  [21XFindHomomorphism[121X  methods, which is also
  described  in that chapter. For the choice of the right method for finding a
  homomorphism  (or  an  isomorphism)  we  use  another generic procedure, the
  [21Xmethod  selection[121X which is not to be confused with the [5XGAP[105X method selection.
  Our  own  method  selection  is  described  in detail in Chapter [14X'recogbase:
  Method  Selection'[114X,  because it is interesting in its own right and might be
  useful in other circumstances.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XMore text on other chapters to be written.[113X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally, Chapter [14X4[114X shows instructive examples for the usage of this package.[133X
