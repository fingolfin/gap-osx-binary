##									   
##  (created from Frank Lübeck's PackageInfo.g template file)
##  
##  This is a GAP readable file. Of course you can change and remove all
##  comments as you like.
##  
##  This file contains meta-information on the package. It is used by
##  the package loading mechanism and the upgrade mechanism for the
##  redistribution of the package via the GAP website.
##  
##  Entries that are commented out are those used for the EDIM package 
##  and are there for purposes of illustration of a possible alternative,
##  especially in the case where the Example package's entry is blank.
##  

##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.4 only the entries
##  .PackageName, .Version, .PackageDoc, .Dependencies, .AvailabilityTest
##  .Autoload   are needed. The other entries are relevant if the
##  package shall be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
##  shall be redistributed via the GAP Website.

##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date and
##  .ArchiveURL must be updated.

SetPackageInfo( rec(

##  This is case sensitive, use your preferred spelling.
#
PackageName := "SONATA",

##  This may be used by a default banner or on a Web page, should fit on
##  one line.
Subtitle := "System of nearrings and their applications",

##  See '?Extending: Version Numbers' in GAP help for an explanation
##  of valid version numbers. For an automatic package distribution update
##  you must provide a new version number even after small changes.
Version := "2.6",

##  Release date of the current version in dd/mm/yyyy format.
# 
Date := "07/11/2012",

##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
##  the format extension(s), like '.zoo', which are given next.
##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
##  example/init.g, ...    or  example-1.3/init.g, ...  )
# 
ArchiveURL := 
#          "http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Greg.Gamble/Example/example-1.5",
	   "http://www.algebra.uni-linz.ac.at/Sonata/sonata-2.6/sonata-2.6",
##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
##  space or commas.
##  Currently recognized formats are:
##      .zoo       the (GAP-traditional) zoo-format with "!TEXT!" comments 
##                 for text files
##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS 
##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
##  
##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.
##  
# ArchiveFormats := ".zoo", # the others are generated automatically
ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these 
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks. There are the following 
##  possibilities to specify the text files:
##  
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the 
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g")
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - if no 'TextFiles' or 'BinaryFiles' are given and a .zoo archive is
##      provided, then the files in that archive with a "!TEXT!" comment are
##      taken as text files
##    - otherwise: exactly the files with names matching the regular expression
##      ".*\(\.txt\|\.gi\|\.gd\|\.g\|\.c\|\.h\|\.htm\|\.html\|\.xml\|\.tex\|\.six\|\.bib\|\.tst\|README.*\|INSTALL.*\|Makefile\)"
##      are taken as text files
##  
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##  
##  These entries are *optional*.
#TextFiles := ["init.g", ......],
#BinaryFiles := ["doc/manual.dvi", ......],


##  Information about authors and maintainers. Specify for each person a 
##  record with the following information:

##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.

##  documentation on the GAP website.

##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (either as URL .Archive
##        if you pack them into a separate archive, or as list 
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of directory and file names which should be
