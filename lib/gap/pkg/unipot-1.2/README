                        Installing UNIPOT
                        -----------------

This document describes the procedure of installing the package.

Installing  `Unipot'  should be easy once you have installed GAP
itself. We assume  here that you want to install `Unipot' in its
standard  location, which  is in the `pkg' subdirectory  of  the
main GAP4 installation.


                           Overview
                           --------

You have to perform the following steps to install `Unipot':

  -- Get the sources.
  -- Unpack the sources with the `unzoo' utility.
  -- Optionally edit the `ALLPKG' file so that the `Unipot'
     documentation will be available when GAP starts up.

               What you need to install `Unipot'
               ---------------------------------

Version 1.2  of  the  package  was  altered  to  support the new
package  loading mechanism of GAP 4.4 and thus requires at least
Version 4.4 of GAP.


              Getting and unpacking the sources
              ---------------------------------

You can download the sources from the same places as GAP:

   http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html

If  you  installed  a recent version of the packages-... file of
the  GAP  distribution,  then  unipot  is  most  likely  already
installed.  If  not,  you  can  download  the  package  `Unipot'
separately.  In  that  case  go to the subdirectory `pkg' of the
main GAP directory (when you installed the  GAP distribution,  a
new  directory  called `gap4r<X>' for some <X> was created; this
directory   contains   the  `pkg'  subdirectory).  The  standard
location would be

   /usr/local/lib/gap4rX/pkg

Then  extract  the  sources  of  the  `Unipot' package. `Unipot'
resides  completely  in  the  following  subdirectory  (assuming
standard location):

   /usr/local/lib/gap4rX/pkg/unipot


     Installing in a different than the standard location
     ----------------------------------------------------

It could happen  that you do not want to install `Unipot' in its
standard  location, perhaps  because you  do not  want to bother
your  system  administrator  and  have  no  access  to  the  GAP
directory.  In this  case  just  unpack  `Unipot'  in  any other
location within a  `pkg' directory as described above. E.g.  the
directory containing  the `pkg' directory is `/home/user/mygap',
then `Unipot' resides in `/home/user/mygap/pkg/unipot'.

Note that you *either* have to edit the startup script `gap.sh':
   Add  `/home/user/mygap'  separating it with a semicolon (`;')
   from previous directories for the variable `GAP_DIR'
*or* you have to start GAP with following command line option:

   # gap4 -l "/usr/local/lib/gap4rX;/home/user/mygap"

                   Loading `Unipot' in GAP
                   -----------------------

The  documentation  of  the  package  is  available  in any GAP4
session,  even  if  the  package  is  not loaded. Like any other
package, `Unipot' is loaded in GAP with

gap> LoadPackage("unipot");

within  the  GAP4  session. If you want the package to be loaded
automatically   everytime   you   start   GAP,   edit  the  file
PackageInfo.g  in  the  unipot  directory  and  change the value
of the variable Autoload to `true' at the end of the file.
