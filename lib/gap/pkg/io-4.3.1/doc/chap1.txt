  [33X[0;0YThe  purpose of this package is to allow efficient and flexible input/output
  operations from [5XGAP[105X. This is achieved by providing bindings to the low-level
  I/O functions in the C-library. On top of this an implementation of buffered
  I/O  in the [5XGAP[105X language is provided. Further, a framework for serialisation
  of  arbitrary  [5XGAP[105X objects is implemented. Finally, an implementation of the
  client side of the HTTP protocol is included in the package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis package allows to use file based I/O, access to links and file systems,
  pipes, sockets, and the UDP and TCP/IP protocols.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  default  the  [5XIO[105X  package  is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[105X when it is
  installed.  You  must  load  the  package with [10XLoadPackage("IO");[110X before its
  functions become available.[133X
