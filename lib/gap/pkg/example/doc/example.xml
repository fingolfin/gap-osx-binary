This chapter  describes  the  &GAP;  package  &Example;.  As  its  name
suggests it is an example of how to  create  a  &GAP;  package.  It  has
little functionality except for being a package.
<P/>
See Sections&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Unpacking the Example Package"/>,
<Ref Sect="Compiling Binaries of the Example Package"/>
and&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Loading the Example Package"/>
for  how  to  install, compile and  load  the  &Example;  package,  or
Appendix&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Guidelines for Writing a GAP Package"/>
for guidelines on how  to  write  a &GAP; package.
