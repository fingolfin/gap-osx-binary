Appendix which was renamed from "Hints..." to "Guidelines..." and 
incorporated many advices to package authors and feedback on the 
previous announcements of the first GAP 4.5 beta release and its 
subsequent update. It has new sections about package testing, 
licensing, upgrading the package to work with GAP 4.5 and, finally, 
two checklists (for package in general and for its upgrade to GAP 4.5). 
The package is now distributed under GPL 2 or higher.

Other changes include:
* Better Makefile.in and configure files provided by Max Horn
* Using CopyHTMLStyleFiles("doc") instead of keeping own style files
* Removing revision entries from files
* Removing old gapmacro.tex-based manual from version control
* Using 'lib' directory for the library, not 'gap'
* Documenting TextBinaryFilesPatterns as an alternative to specify 
  text/binary files
* Demonstrating how to create a test file
* Demonstrating how to distribute parts of the manual across source 
  code files
* Demonstrating MathJax support in the HTML version of the manual.

Version 3.0: 2011/03/15
* First attempt of upgrading the package for GAP 4.5, released as 
  a part of GAP 4.5.1 (first beta release). Appendix is merged with
  the former "Writing a GAP package" chapter from the reference 
  manual in order to consolidate most of the guidelines for writing 
  a GAP package in a single location.
