  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is the role of the [5XModules[105X[101X[1X package in the [5Xhomalg[105X[101X[1X project?[133X[101X
  
  
  [1X1.1-1 [33X[0;0Y[5XModules[105X[101X[1X provides ...[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt provides procedures to construct basic objects in homological algebra:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ymodules (generators, relations)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ysubmodules (as images of maps)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ymaps[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBeside  these  so-called constructors [5XModules[105X provides [13Xoperations[113X to perform
  computations with these objects. The list of operations includes:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yresolution of modules[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yimages of maps[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ythe  functors  [10XHom[110X and [10XTensorProduct[110X ([10XExt[110X and [10XTor[110X are then provided by
        [5Xhomalg[105X)[133X

        torsion-freeness, and codegree of purity of a module[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUsing  the  philosophy  of  [5XGAP4[105X, one or more methods are [13Xinstalled[113X for each
  operation,  depending  on  [13Xproperties[113X and [13Xattributes[113X of these objects. These
  properties  and  attributes  can themselves be computed by methods installed
  for this purpose.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-2 [33X[0;0YRings supported in a sufficient way[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThrough  out  this  manual  the following terminology is used. We say that a
  computer  algebra  system  [21Xsufficiently  supports[121X  a  ring [22XR[122X, if it contains
  procedures  to effectively solve one-sided inhomogeneous linear systems [22XXA=B[122X
  and [22XAX=B[122X with coefficients over [22XR[122X (--> [14X1.1-3[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-3 [33X[0;0YPrincipal limitation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote that the solution space of the one-sided finite dimensional system [22XYA=0[122X
  (resp.  [22XAY=0[122X)  over  a  left  (resp.  right) noetherian ring [22XR[122X is a finitely
  generated  left  (resp.  right)  [22XR[122X-module, even if [22XR[122X is not commutative. The
  solution  space of the linear system [22XX_1 A_1 + A_2 X_2 + A_3 X_3 A_4=0[122X is in
  general  not  an [22XR[122X-module, and worse, in general not finitely generated over
  the  center  of [22XR[122X. [5XModules[105X can only handle homological problems that lead to
  [13Xone  sided[113X  [13Xfinite dimensional[113X homogeneous or inhomogeneous systems over the
  underlying  ring [22XR[122X. Such problems are called problems of [13Xfinite type[113X over [22XR[122X.
  Typically,  the  computation  of  [10XHom[110X[22X(M,N)[122X  of two (even) finitely generated
  modules over a [13Xnon[113Xcommutative ring [22XR[122X is generally [13Xnot[113X of finite type over [22XR[122X,
  unless at least one of the two modules is an [22XR[122X-bimodule. Also note that over
  a  commutative  ring  any linear system can be easily brought to a one-sided
  form. For more details see [BR08].[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-4 [33X[0;0YRing dictionaries (technical)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XModules[105X uses the so-called [10XhomalgTable[110X, which is stored in the ring, to know
  how to delegate the necessary matrix operations. I.e. the [10XhomalgTable[110X serves
  as  a  small dictionary that enables [5XModules[105X to speak (as much as needed of)
  the  language  of  the  computer algebra system which hosts the ring and the
  matrices.  The  [5XGAP[105X internal ring of integers is the only ring which [5XModules[105X
  endows   with   a   [10XhomalgTable[110X.  Other  packages  like  [5XGaussForHomalg[105X  and
  [5XRingsForHomalg[105X  provide dictionaries for further rings. While [5XGaussForHomalg[105X
  defines  internal  rings  and  matrices,  the package [5XRingsForHomalg[105X enables
  defining  external rings and matrices in a wide range of (external) computer
  algebra  systems  ([5XSingular[105X,  [5XSage[105X,  [5XMacaulay2[105X,  [5XMAGMA[105X,  [5XMaple[105X) by providing
  appropriate dictionaries.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSince these dictionaries are all what is needed to handle matrix operations,
  [5XModules[105X does not distinguish between handling internal and handling external
  matrices.  Even  the physical communication with the external systems is not
  at  all  a  concern of [5XModules[105X. This is the job of the package [5XIO_ForHomalg[105X,
  which  is  based  on the powerful [5XIO[105X package of Max NeunhÃ¶ffer. Furthermore,
  for all structures beyond matrices (from relations, generators, and modules,
  to  functors and spectral sequences) [5XModules[105X no longer distinguishes between
  internal and external.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-5 [33X[0;0YThe advantages of the outsourcing concept[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLinking  different  systems to achieve one task is a highly attractive idea,
  especially if it helps to avoid reinventing wheels over and over again. This
  was  essential  for [5Xhomalg[105X, since [5XSingular[105X and [5XMAGMA[105X provide the fastest and
  most  advanced  GrÃ¶bner  basis  algorithms,  while  [5XGAP4[105X  is by far the most
  convenient  programming  language to realize complex mathematical structures
  (-->  Appendix  [14X'homalg:  Why  GAP4?'[114X).  Second,  the  implementation of the
  homological   constructions   is   automatically   universal,  since  it  is
  independent  of  where  the  matrices  reside  and  how  the  several matrix
  operations  are  realized.  In particular, [5Xhomalg[105X will always be able to use
  the system with the fastest GrÃ¶bner basis implementation. In this respect is
  [5Xhomalg[105X and all packages that build upon it future proof.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-6 [33X[0;0YDoes this mean that [5Xhomalg[105X[101X[1X has only algorithms for the generic case?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YNo,  on the contrary. There are a lot of specialized algorithms installed in
  [5Xhomalg[105X.  These  algorithms  are  based  on properties and attributes that --
  thanks  to [5XGAP4[105X -- [5Xhomalg[105X objects can carry (--> Appendix [14X'homalg: GAP4 is a
  mathematical  object-oriented  programming  language'[114X):  Not only can [5Xhomalg[105X
  take  the  special nature of the underlying ring into account, it also deals
  with  modules,  complexes, ... depending on their special properties. Still,
  these  special algorithms, like all algorithms in [5Xhomalg[105X, are independent of
  the  computer algebra system which hosts the matrices and which will perform
  the several matrix operations.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-7 [33X[0;0YThe principle of least communication (technical)[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLinking  different systems can also be highly problematic. The following two
  points are often among the major sources of difficulties:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDifferent systems use different languages:[133X
        [33X[0;6YIt  takes  a  huge  amount  of  time  and  effort to teach systems the
        dialects of each others. These dialects are also rarely fixed forever,
        and  might very well be subject to slight modifications. So the larger
        the dictionary, the more difficult is its maintenance.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YData has to be transferred from one system to another:[133X
        [33X[0;6YEven  if  there  is  a  unified data format, transferring data between
        systems  can  lead to performance losses, especially when a big amount
        of data has to be transferred.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSolving  these  two  difficulties  is an important part of [5XModules[105X's design.
  [5XModules[105X  splits homological computations into two parts. The matrices reside
  in a system which provides fast matrix operations (addition, multiplication,
  bases  and  normal form computations), while the higher structures (modules,
  maps,  complexes,  chain  morphisms, spectral sequences, functors, ...) with
  their  properties,  attributes,  and  algorithms live in [5XGAP4[105X, as the system
  where  one  can  easily  create such complex structures and handle all their
  logical dependencies. With this split there is no need to transfer each sort
  of  data outside of its system. The remaining communication between [5XGAP4[105X and
  the system hosting the matrices gets along with a tiny dictionary. Moreover,
  [5XGAP4[105X,  as  it manages and delegates all computations, also manages the whole
  data flow, while the other system does not even recognize that it is part of
  a bidirectional communication.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  existence  of  such  a clear cut is certainly to some extent due to the
  special nature of homological computations.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1-8 [33X[0;0YFrequently asked questions[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XQ[112X:  Does outsourcing the matrices mean that [5XModules[105X is able to compute
        spectral  sequences,  for  example,  without  ever seeing the matrices
        involved in the computation?[133X
        [33X[0;6YA: Yes.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XQ[112X:   Can   [5XModules[105X  profit  from  the  implementation  of  homological
        constructions like [10XHom[110X, [10XExt[110X, ... in [5XSingular[105X?[133X
        [33X[0;6YA:  No.  This  is  for a lot of reasons incompatible with the idea and
        design (--> [14X1[114X) of [5XModules[105X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XQ[112X: Are the external systems involved in the higher algorithms?[133X
        [33X[0;6YA:  No.  They  host  all  the  matrices  and  do all matrix operations
        delegated  to  them  without  knowing  what  for.  The  meaning of the
        matrices and their logical interrelation is only known to [5XGAP4[105X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[12XQ[112X:  Do  developers  of  packages  building  upon  [5XModules[105X need to know
        anything about the communication with the external systems?[133X
        [33X[0;6YA:  No,  unless they want to use more features of the external systems
        than  those reflected by [5XModules[105X. For this purpose, developers can use
        the  unified  communication interface provideb by [5XHomalgToCAS[105X. This is
        the interface used by [5XModules[105X.[133X
