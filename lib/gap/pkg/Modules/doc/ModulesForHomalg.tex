\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{What is the role of the \textsf{Modules} package in the \textsf{homalg} project?}}\label{Modules-role}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X83B9348878B98FCB}{}
{
  
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{\textsf{Modules} provides ...}}\label{Modules-provides}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 1 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7A734C2E8709258F}{}
{
  It provides procedures to construct basic objects in homological algebra: 
\begin{itemize}
\item modules (generators, relations)
\item submodules (as images of maps)
\item maps
\end{itemize}
 Beside these so-called constructors \textsf{Modules} provides  \emph{operations} to perform computations with these objects. The list of operations includes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item resolution of modules
\item images of maps
\item the functors \texttt{Hom} and \texttt{TensorProduct} (\texttt{Ext} and \texttt{Tor} are then provided by \textsf{homalg})
\item test if a module is torsion-free, reflexive, projective, stably free, free,
pure
\item determine the rank, grade, projective dimension, degree of torsion-freeness,
and codegree of purity of a module
\end{itemize}
 Using the philosophy of \textsf{GAP4}, one or more  methods are  \emph{installed} for each operation, depending on  \emph{properties} and  \emph{attributes} of these objects. These properties and attributes can themselves be computed
by methods installed for this purpose. }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Rings supported in a sufficient way}}\label{SufficientSupport}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 2 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X84913827857A1F7B}{}
{
  Through out this manual the following terminology is used. We say that a
computer algebra system ``sufficiently supports'' a ring $R$, if it contains procedures to effectively solve one-sided inhomogeneous
linear systems $XA=B$ and $AX=B$ with coefficients over $R$ ($\to$ \ref{Modules-limitation}). }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Principal limitation}}\label{Modules-limitation}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 3 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7C31B1FE786E596E}{}
{
  Note that the solution space of the one-sided finite dimensional system $YA=0$ (resp. $AY=0$) over a left (resp. right) noetherian ring $R$ is a finitely generated left (resp. right) $R$-module, even if $R$ is not commutative. The solution space of the linear system $X_1 A_1 + A_2 X_2 + A_3 X_3 A_4=0$ is in general not an $R$-module, and worse, in general not finitely generated over the center of $R$. \textsf{Modules} can only handle homological problems that lead to \emph{one sided} \emph{finite dimensional} homogeneous or inhomogeneous systems over the underlying ring $R$. Such problems are called problems of \emph{finite type} over $R$. Typically, the computation of \texttt{Hom}$(M,N)$ of two (even) finitely generated modules over a \emph{non}commutative ring $R$ is generally \emph{not} of finite type over $R$, unless at least one of the two modules is an $R$-bimodule. Also note that over a commutative ring any linear system can be
easily brought to a one-sided form. For more details see \cite{BR}. 

 }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Ring dictionaries (technical)}}\label{Modules-dict}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 4 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X8583D47D7E570356}{}
{
  \textsf{Modules} uses the so-called \texttt{homalgTable}, which is stored in the ring, to know how to delegate the necessary matrix
operations. I.e. the \texttt{homalgTable} serves as a small dictionary that enables \textsf{Modules} to speak (as much as needed of) the language of the computer algebra system
which hosts the ring and the matrices. The \textsf{GAP} internal ring of integers is the only ring which \textsf{Modules} endows with a \texttt{homalgTable}. Other packages like \textsf{GaussForHomalg} and \textsf{RingsForHomalg} provide dictionaries for further rings. While \textsf{GaussForHomalg} defines internal rings and matrices, the package \textsf{RingsForHomalg} enables defining external rings and matrices in a wide range of (external)
computer algebra systems (\textsf{Singular}, \textsf{Sage}, \textsf{Macaulay2}, \textsf{MAGMA}, \textsf{Maple}) by providing appropriate dictionaries. 

 Since these dictionaries are all what is needed to handle matrix operations, \textsf{Modules} does not distinguish between handling internal and handling external matrices.
Even the physical communication with the external systems is not at all a
concern of \textsf{Modules}. This is the job of the package \textsf{IO{\textunderscore}ForHomalg}, which is based on the powerful \textsf{IO} package of Max Neunh{\"o}ffer. Furthermore, for all structures beyond matrices
(from relations, generators, and modules, to functors and spectral sequences) \textsf{Modules} no longer distinguishes between internal and external. 

 }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{The advantages of the outsourcing concept}}\label{outsource}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 5 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7D7570837C21607A}{}
{
  Linking different systems to achieve one task is a highly attractive idea,
especially if it helps to avoid reinventing wheels over and over again. This
was essential for \textsf{homalg}, since \textsf{Singular} and \textsf{MAGMA} provide the fastest and most advanced Gr{\"o}bner basis algorithms, while \textsf{GAP4} is by far the most convenient programming language to realize complex
mathematical structures ($\to$ Appendix  (\textbf{homalg: Why GAP4?})). Second, the implementation of the homological constructions is
automatically universal, since it is independent of where the matrices reside
and how the several matrix operations are realized. In particular, \textsf{homalg} will always be able to use the system with the fastest Gr{\"o}bner basis
implementation. In this respect is \textsf{homalg} and all packages that build upon it future proof. }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Does this mean that \textsf{homalg} has only algorithms for the generic case?}}\label{also-special}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 6 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7C9DE9DF7F37B4EB}{}
{
  No, on the contrary. There are a lot of specialized algorithms installed in \textsf{homalg}. These algorithms are based on properties and attributes that -- thanks to \textsf{GAP4} -- \textsf{homalg} objects can carry ($\to$ Appendix  (\textbf{homalg: GAP4 is a mathematical object-oriented programming language})): Not only can \textsf{homalg} take the special nature of the underlying ring into account, it also deals
with modules, complexes, ... depending on their special properties. Still,
these special algorithms, like all algorithms in \textsf{homalg}, are independent of the computer algebra system which hosts the matrices and
which will perform the several matrix operations. }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{The principle of least communication (technical)}}\label{least-communication}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 7 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X79DFCAF17BD3DDC6}{}
{
  Linking different systems can also be highly problematic. The following two
points are often among the major sources of difficulties: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Different systems use different languages:\\
 It takes a huge amount of time and effort to teach systems the dialects of
each others. These dialects are also rarely fixed forever, and might very well
be subject to slight modifications. So the larger the dictionary, the more
difficult is its maintenance.
\item Data has to be transferred from one system to another:\\
 Even if there is a unified data format, transferring data between systems can
lead to performance losses, especially when a big amount of data has to be
transferred.
\end{itemize}
 Solving these two difficulties is an important part of \textsf{Modules}'s design. \textsf{Modules} splits homological computations into two parts. The matrices reside in a
system which provides fast matrix operations (addition, multiplication, bases
and normal form computations), while the higher structures (modules, maps,
complexes, chain morphisms, spectral sequences, functors, ...) with their
properties, attributes, and algorithms live in \textsf{GAP4}, as the system where one can easily create such complex structures and handle
all their logical dependencies. With this split there is no need to transfer
each sort of data outside of its system. The remaining communication between \textsf{GAP4} and the system hosting the matrices gets along with a tiny dictionary.
Moreover, \textsf{GAP4}, as it manages and delegates all computations, also manages the whole data
flow, while the other system does not even recognize that it is part of a
bidirectional communication. 

 The existence of such a clear cut is certainly to some extent due to the
special nature of homological computations. }

 
\subsection{\textcolor{Chapter }{Frequently asked questions}}\label{FAQ}
\logpage{[ 1, 1, 8 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7D51BC7A80D43EA0}{}
{
  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{Q}: Does outsourcing the matrices mean that \textsf{Modules} is able to compute spectral sequences, for example, without ever seeing the
matrices involved in the computation?\\
\\
 A: Yes.
\item \textsc{Q}: Can \textsf{Modules} profit from the implementation of homological constructions like \texttt{Hom}, \texttt{Ext}, ... in \textsf{Singular}?\\
\\
 A: No. This is for a lot of reasons incompatible with the  idea and design ($\to$ \ref{intro}) of \textsf{Modules}.
\item \textsc{Q}: Are the external systems involved in the higher algorithms?\\
\\
 A: No. They host all the matrices and do all matrix operations delegated to
them without knowing what for. The meaning of the matrices and their logical
interrelation is only known to \textsf{GAP4}.
\item \textsc{Q}: Do developers of packages building upon \textsf{Modules} need to know anything about the communication with the external systems?\\
\\
 A: No, unless they want to use more features of the external systems than
those reflected by \textsf{Modules}. For this purpose, developers can use the unified communication interface
provideb by \textsf{HomalgToCAS}. This is the interface used by \textsf{Modules}.

\logpage{[ 3, 1, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X863CD6AA80705231}{}
{
  As the reader might notice, all examples in this manual will be either over
{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}} or over one of its residue class rings ${\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}/m{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}$. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that \textsf{GAP} does not natively support rings other than {\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}} in a \emph{sufficient} way ($\to$ \ref{SufficientSupport}). 

 The second and more important reason is to underline the fact the all
effective homological constructions that are relevant for \textsf{Modules} have only as much to do with the Gr{\"o}bnerbasis algorithm as they do with
the Hermite algorithm for the ring {\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}; both algorithms
are used to effectively solve inhomogeneous linear systems over the respective
ring. And \textsf{Modules} is designed to use rings and matrices over these rings together with all their
operations as a black box. In other words: Because \textsf{Modules} works for ${\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}$, it works by its design for all other computable rings.  }

  The following example is taken from Section 2 of \cite{BREACA}. \\
\\
 The computation takes place over the residue class ring $R={\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}/2^8{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}$ using the generic support for residue class rings provided by the subpackage \textsf{ResidueClassRingForHomalg} of the \textsf{MatricesForHomalg} package. For a native support of the rings $R={\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}/p^n{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}$ use the \textsf{GaussForHomalg} package. 

 Here we compute the (infinite) long exact homology sequence of the covariant
functor $Hom(Hom(-,{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}/2^7{\ensuremath{\mathbb
Z}}),{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}}/2^4{\ensuremath{\mathbb Z}})$ (and its left derived functors) applied to the short exact sequence\\

  A finite presentation of a module is given by a finite set of generators and a
finite set of relations among these generators. In \textsf{homalg} a set of relations of a left/right module is given by a matrix \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape rel}}, the rows/columns of which are interpreted as relations among $n$ generators, $n$ being the number of columns/rows of the matrix \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape rel}}. 

 The data structure of a module in \textsf{homalg} is designed to contain not only one but several sets of relations (together
with corresponding sets of generators ($\to$ Chapter \ref{Generators})). The different sets of relations are linked with so-called transition
matrices ($\to$ Chapter \ref{Modules}). 

 The relations of a \textsf{homalg} module are evaluated in a lazy way. This avoids unnecessary computations.

{
  A \textsf{homalg} module is a data structure for a finitely presented module. A presentation is
given by a set of generators and a set of relations among these generators.
The data structure for modules in \textsf{homalg} has two novel features: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  The data structure allows several presentations linked with so-called
transition matrices. One of the presentations is marked as the default
presentation, which is usually the last added one. A new presentation can
always be added provided it is linked to the default presentation by a
transition matrix. If needed, the user can reset the default presentation by
choosing one of the other presentations saved in the data structure of the \textsf{homalg} module. Effectively, a module is then given by ``all'' its presentations (as ``coordinates'') together with isomorphisms between them (as ``coordinate changes''). Being able to ``change coordinates'' makes the realization of a module in \textsf{homalg} \emph{intrinsic} (or ``coordinate free''). 
\item  To present a left/right module it suffices to take a matrix \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape M}} and interpret its rows/columns as relations among $n$ \emph{abstract} generators, where $n$ is the number of columns/rows of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape M}}. Only that these abstract generators are useless when it comes to specific
modules like modules of homomorphisms, where one expects the generators to be
maps between modules. For this reason a presentation of a module in \textsf{homalg} is not merely a matrix of relations, but together with a set of generators.

{
  A \textsf{homalg} map is a data structures for maps (module homomorphisms) between finitely
generated modules. Each map in \textsf{homalg} knows its source ($\to$ \texttt{Source} (\textbf{homalg: Source})) and its target ($\to$ \texttt{Range} (\textbf{homalg: Range})). A map is represented by a \textsf{homalg} matrix relative to the current set of generators of the source resp. target \textsf{homalg} module. As with modules ($\to$ Chapter \ref{Modules}), maps in \textsf{homalg} are realized in an intrinsic manner: If the presentations of the source or/and
target module are altered after the map was constructed, a new adapted
representation matrix of the map is automatically computed whenever needed.
For this the internal transition matrices of the modules are used. \textsf{homalg} uses the so-called \emph{associative} convention for maps. This means that maps of left modules are applied from the
right, whereas maps of right modules from the left.

Unless the source module is free \emph{and} given on free generators the returned map will cautiously be indicated using
parenthesis: ``homomorphism''. To verify if the result is indeed a well defined map use \texttt{IsMorphism} (\textbf{homalg: IsMorphism}). If the presentations of the source or/and target module are altered after

right, whereas maps of right modules from the left.

 Compute a pre-inverse of the morphism \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape phi}} in case one exists. For a pre-inverse to exist \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape phi}} must be an epimorphism. For \emph{commutative} rings \textsf{homalg} has an algorithm installed which decides the existence and returns a
pre-inverse in case one exists. If a pre-inverse does not exist then \texttt{false} is returned. The algorithm finds a particular solution of a two-side
inhomogeneous linear system over $R := $\texttt{HomalgRing}$( \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape phi}} )$. For \emph{non}commutative rings a heuristic method is installed. If it finds a pre-inverse
it returns it, otherwise it returns \texttt{fail} ($\to$ \ref{Modules-limitation}). The operation \texttt{PreInverse} is used to install a method for the property \texttt{IsSplitEpimorphism} (\textbf{homalg: IsSplitEpimorphism}). 

 \texttt{PreInverse} checks if it can decide the projectivity of \texttt{Range}$( \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape phi}} )$. }

  What follows are several operations related to the exterior algebra of a free
module: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A constructor for the graded parts of the exterior algebra (``exterior powers'')
\item Several Operations on elements of these exterior powers
\item A constructor for the ``Koszul complex''
\item An implementation of the ``Cayley determinant'' as defined in \cite{CQ11}, which allows calculating greatest common divisors from finite free
resolutions.

{
  As finite dimensional constructions in linear algebra over a field $k$ boil down to solving (in)homogeneous linear systems over $k$, the Gaussian algorithm makes the whole theory perfectly computable. 

 Hence, for homological algebra (viewed as linear algebra over general rings)
to be computable one needs to find appropriate substitutes for the Gaussian
algorithm, where finite dimensionality has to be replaced by finite
generatedness. 

 Luckily such substitutes exist for many rings of interest. Beside the
well-known Hermite normal form algorithm for principal ideal rings it turns
out that appropriate generalizations of the classical Gr{\"o}bner basis
algorithm for polynomial rings provide the desired substitute for a wide class
of commutative \emph{and} noncommutative rings. Note that for noncommutative rings the above discussion
has to be restricted to homological constructions leading to one-sided linear
systems $XA=B$ resp. $AX=B$ ($\to$ \ref{Modules-limitation}).
