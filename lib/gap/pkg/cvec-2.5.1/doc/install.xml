<Chapter Label="install">
<Heading>Installation of the <Package>cvec</Package>-Package</Heading>
<Index><Package>cvec</Package></Index>

To get the newest version of this &GAP; 4 package download one of the
archive files
<List>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.tar.gz</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.tar.bz2</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.zip</F> </Item>
</List>
and unpack it using 
<Verb>
gunzip cvec-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf cvec-x.x.tar
</Verb>
or
<Verb>
bzip2 -d cvec-x.x.tar.bz2; tar xvf cvec-x.x.tar
</Verb>
or
<Verb>
unzip -x cvec-x.x.zip
</Verb>
respectively.
<P/>

Do this in a directory called <Q><F>pkg</F></Q>, preferably (but not
necessarily) in the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> subdirectory of your &GAP; 4
installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Q><F>cvec</F></Q>.<P/>

The package  will not work without the following compilation step.<P/>

To compile the C part of the package do (in the <F>pkg</F> directory)

<Verb>
    cd cvec
    ./configure
    make
</Verb>

If you installed the package in another <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory than
the standard <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory in your &GAP; 4 installation,
then you have to do two things. Firstly during compilation you have
to use the option <C>--with-gaproot=PATH</C> of the <F>configure</F>
script where <Q>PATH</Q> is a path to the main &GAP; root directory
(if not given the default <Q><F>../..</F></Q> is assumed). <P/>
Secondly you have to specify the path to the directory containing
your <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory to &GAP;'s list of directories. This
can be done by starting &GAP; with the <Q><F>-l</F></Q> command line
option followed by the name of the directory and a semicolon. Then your
directory is prepended to the list of directories searched. Otherwise
the package is not found by &GAP;. Of course, you can add this option to
your &GAP; startup script. <P/>

If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either
do this immediately after configuring and compiling &GAP; itself on
this architecture, or alternatively (when using version 4.5 of &GAP;
or newer) set the environment variable <C>CONFIGNAME</C> to the name
of the configuration you used when compiling &GAP; before running
<C>./configure</C>. Note however that your compiler choice and flags
(environment variables <C>CC</C> and <C>CFLAGS</C>) need to be chosen to
match the setup of the original &GAP; compilation. For example you have
to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly!<P/>
