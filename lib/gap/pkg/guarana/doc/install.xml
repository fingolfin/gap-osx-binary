    </Heading>
    The Guarana package is part of the standard distribution of &GAP; and
    so normally there should be no need to install it separately.
    If by any chance it is not part of your &GAP; distribution, then 
  	the standard method is to unpack the package into the `pkg'
  	directory  of your &GAP; distribution.  This will create a `guarana'
  	subdirectory. 
  	For other non-standard options please see Chapter
  	<Ref Chap="Installing a GAP Package" BookName="ref" /> of the &GAP; 
  	Reference Manual.

  	Note that the GAP-Packages Polycyclic and Polenta
  	are needed for this package.
  	Normally they should be contained in your distribution. If not, 
  	they can be obtained at
  	<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</URL>

  	<Heading>Loading the Guarana package
  	</Heading>
  	If the <Package>Guarana</Package> Package is not already loaded 
  	then you have to request it explicitly. 
  	This can be done by `LoadPackage("guarana")'.
  	The `LoadPackage' command is described in Section
  	<Ref Sect="LoadPackage" BookName="ref" />
  	in the &GAP; Reference Manual.

	<Heading>Running the test suite
	</Heading>
	Once the package is installed, it is possible to check the correct
	installation by running the test suite of the package.

	<Example>
	gap> Read(Filename(DirectoriesPackageLibrary("guarana","tst")[1],"testall.g"));
	</Example>

	Note that this now disables running of the tests in tst/guarana2.tst, since
	these require alnuth which in turn requires kash/kant. If your system has
	these prerequisites in place you can manually run those test examples as
	follows.
	
	<Example>
	gap> ReadTest(Filename(DirectoriesPackageLibrary("guarana","tst")[1],"guarana2.tst"));
	</Example>
	
	For more details on  Test Files see 
	Section <Ref Sect="Test Files" BookName="ref" /> of the 
	&GAP; Reference Manual.

	If the test suite runs into an error, 
	then please send a message
  	to `jjm@mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk' including the error message.
