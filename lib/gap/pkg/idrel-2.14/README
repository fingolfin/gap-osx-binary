                   The IdRel package - version 2.14

This is the README file for the GAP package ``IdRel''.

The IdRel package is designed for computing the identities among relations 
of a group presentation using rewriting, logged rewriting, 
monoid polynomials, module polynomials and Y-sequences.

Version 1.001 of ``IdRel'' formed part of Anne Heyworth's PhD thesis in
December 1999.
Version 2.02 was prepared for the GAP 4.4 release in March 2006 
(with one minor typo fixed on 02/06/06), 
and deposited in the incoming directory on the St Andrews ftp server.
A more detailed history will be included as Chapter 6 of the manual.
Version 2.04 was released on 14th November 2008, 
where the main change was the move to a new package website.  
Version 2.12 was released in April 2012 for the anticipated release 
of GAP 4.5. 
The latest version is 2.14, releassed on January 11th 2013 for GAP 4.6. 

The ``IdRel'' package is distributed with the deposited GAP packages.
It may also be obtained from the Bangor ftp pages for
Computational Higher-dimensional Discrete Algebra at:
