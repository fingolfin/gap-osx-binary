# Our own method selection code:

SetInfoLevel(InfoMethSel,1);
DeclareGlobalFunction( "AddMethod" );
DeclareGlobalVariable( "NotApplicable" );
DeclareGlobalFunction( "CallMethods" );

# The following method has to be here because recogbase already uses
# it in its reading of the implemenation phase. This is if recogbase
# is loaded explicitly.

# Add a method to a database with "AddMethod" and call a method from a
# database with "CallMethods".
#
InstallGlobalFunction( "AddMethod", function(arg)
  # First argument is the method database, second is the method itself,
  # third is the rank, fourth is the stamp. An optional 5th argument is
  # the comment.
  local comment,db,i,l,mr,p;
