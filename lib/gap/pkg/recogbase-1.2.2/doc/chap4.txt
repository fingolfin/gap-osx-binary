  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter describes a generic framework for group recognition. The basic
  problem  is, we want to solve the constructive membership problem: given any
  [22Xg âˆˆ G[122X, [22XG = âŸ¨ X âŸ©[122X, write a straight line program (SLP) from [22XX[122X to [22Xg[122X, for [22Xg âˆ‰ G[122X
  (in  the situation that [22XG[122X is naturally embedded into some bigger group), the
  algorithm  should  fail.  This  is  usually  done  by constructing some nice
  generators  (and  then  writing  an  SLP  from  the nice generators to [22Xg[122X and
  concatenating  with  an  SLP  from  [22XX[122X  to  the  nice generators). Often, for
  efficiency  reasons, we will just store the nice generators and then only be
  interested  in  the  SLP from those to [22Xg[122X. The framework presented here deals
  with exactly this process.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   generic  framework  was  designed  having  four  situations  in  mind:
  permutation  groups,  matrix groups, projective groups and black box groups.
  Although the methods used are quite different for those four cases, there is
  a  common  pattern in the procedure of recognition. Namely, first we have to
  find  a  homomorphism, solve the constructive membership problem recursively
  in  image  and  kernel,  then  put it together. The recursion ends in groups
  where we can solve the constructive membership problem directly. The general
  framework  reflects  this  idea  and  separates  it  from  the  rest  of the
  recognition methods.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSolution of the constructive membership problem comes in two stages: first a
  [21Xrecognition  phase[121X  and  then  a  [21Xverification  phase[121X. The recognition phase
  usually  consists  of  randomised  algorithms  with certain error or failure
  probabilities.  The result is some kind of [21Xrecognition information[121X that will
  describe  the  group  already  very  well, but which is not yet proven to be
  correct.  However,  one can already write arbitrary elements in the group as
  product of the given generators. In the verification phase a presentation of
  the  group  is  calculated,  thereby proving that the group generated by the
  given  generators  is  in  fact  isomorphic  to  the  group described by the
  recognition  information.  In many cases the verification phase will be much
  more expensive than the recognition phase.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  the following sections, we describe the generic framework. We begin with
  a technical description of the recursive procedure and describe then the way
  methods  to  find homomorphism have to be implemented. Finally, we have four
  sections  in  which  we collect conventions for the recognition of different
  types of groups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNo actual recognition methods are implemented in this package. See the [5Xrecog[105X
  package for an implementation and description of them.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YThe recursive procedure[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  explained at the beginning of this section, the heart of the recognition
  procedure  is  a  function  called [2XRecogniseGeneric[102X ([14X4.1-1[114X) which gets a [5XGAP[105X
  group object and returns a so-called [21Xrecognition info record[121X (see Subsection
  [14X4.2[114X  for details). Success or failure will be indicated by this record being
  in the filter [2XIsReady[102X ([14X4.2-4[114X) or not.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  know  how  to find homomorphisms the function gets as another argument a
  database  of  methods  (see  Section  [14X4.3[114X for a description of the setup for
  methods  for  finding homomorphisms and Section [14X3.1[114X in Chapter [14X3[114X for details
  about  method  databases).  This database will be different according to the
  type of group in question.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  describe  the  algorithm  executed  by [2XRecogniseGeneric[102X ([14X4.1-1[114X) we first
  summarise it in steps:[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6YCreate a new, empty recognition info record.[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6YUse  the database of [10XFindHomomorphism[110X methods and the method selection
        procedure  described in Chapter [14X3[114X to try to find a homomorphism onto a
        smaller  group  or  an isomorphism onto another known group. Terminate
        with failure if this does not work.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6YIf  an  isomorphism  is  found or a method somehow else recognises the
        group  in  question,  such that we can write elements as straight line
        programs in the generators from now on, then make the recognition info
        record a leaf of the recognition tree and return success.[133X
  
  [31X4[131X   [33X[0;6YOtherwise  the  function sets up all the data for the homomorphism and
        calls  itself with the image of the homomorphism. Note that this might
        use  another  database of recognition methods because the homomorphism
        might change the representation of the group.[133X
  
  [31X5[131X   [33X[0;6YAfter  successful recognition of the factor group the procedure has to
        recognise  the  kernel of the homomorphism. The first step for this is
        to   find   generators.  If  they  are  not  already  known  from  the
        [10XFindHomomorphism[110X method, they are created by producing random elements
        in the group, mapping them through the homomorphism, writing them as a
        straight  line  program  in  the images of the generators and applying
        this straight line program to the original generators. The quotient of
        the random element and the result of the straight line program lies in
        the kernel of the homomorphism. After creating 20 random generators of
        the kernel we assume for the moment that they generate the kernel.[133X
  
  [31X6[131X   [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XRecogniseGeneric[102X  ([14X4.1-1[114X)  can  now call itself for the
        kernel.  After  successful  recognition of the kernel all the data for
        the node is completed and success is returned.[133X
  
  [31X7[131X   [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XRecogniseGeneric[102X  ([14X4.1-1[114X) now acquires preimages of the
        nice   generators   behind  the  homomorphism  and  appends  the  nice
        generators  of  the kernel. This list of generators is now the list of
        nice generators for the current node.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  with  the collected data one can write arbitrary elements of the
  group as a straight line program in the generators as follows:[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6YMap the element through the homomorphism.[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6YWrite  the  element  in  the  factor  group  as  a product of the nice
        generators in the factor group.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6YApply  the  resulting  straight line program to the preimages of those
        nice  generators and calculate the quotient, which will now lie in the
        kernel.[133X
  
  [31X4[131X   [33X[0;6YWrite  the  kernel  element  as  a straight line program in the kernel
        generators.[133X
  
  [31X5[131X   [33X[0;6YAssemble  both  straight  line  programs  to  one bigger straight line
        program  (which is now in terms of our own nice generators) and return
        it.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  this  procedure fails in the fourth step, this indicates that our random
  generators  for  the  kernel  did not yet generate the full kernel and makes
  further recognition steps necessary. This will not happen after a successful
  verification phase.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  latter  procedure  to  write  elements as straight line programs in the
  generators is implemented in the function [2XSLPforElementGeneric[102X ([14X4.3-2[114X) which
  will  be  called  automatically  if  one  calls  the  [2XSLPforElement[102X ([14X4.2-14[114X)
  function  of  the  resulting  recognition  info  record  (see  [2Xslpforelement[102X
  ([14X4.2-13[114X)).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  now  high time to give you the calling details of the main recursive
  recognition function:[133X

  sense  of  Section  [14X3.1[114X  containing [10XFindHomomorphism[110X methods in the sense of
  Section [14X4.3[114X. [3Xdepth[103X is an integer which measures the depth in the recognition
  tree. It will be increased by one for each step we go into the tree. The top
  level  has  depth 0. [3Xknowledge[103X is an optional record the components of which
  are  copied  into  the  new recognition info record which is created for the
  group  [3XH[103X.  Especially  the  component [10Xhints[110X can contain a list of additional
  find  homomorphism methods (described by records as in Section [14X3.1[114X) which is
  prepended  to the method database in [3Xmethoddb[103X before the recognition starts.
  This  feature  is  intended  to give hints about prior knowledge about which
  find homomorphism method might succeed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  function performs the algorithm described above and returns either [10Xfail[110X
  in  case of failure or a recognition info record in case of success. For the

  [33X[0;0YThis  attribute is initialised at the beginning of the recursive recognition
  function  with  the  database  of find homomorphism methods that was used to
  recognise  the group corresponding to the recognition info record [3Xri[103X. If the
  found  homomorphism  changes  the  representation  of  the  group (going for
  example  from  a matrix group to a permutation group), the find homomorphism
  method  can  report  this  by  exchanging  the database of find homomorphism
  methods  to  be  used in the recognition of the image of the homomorphism by
  setting  the  value of this attribute to something different. It lies in the
  responsibility   of   the   find  homomorphism  method  to  do  so,  if  the
  representation changes through the homomorphism.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  following  two  attributes  are concerned with the relation between the
  original  generators  and  the  nice generators for a node. They are used to
  transport  this information from a successful find homomorphism method up to
  the recursive recognition function:[133X
  
  [1X4.2-17 calcnicegens[101X
  
  [29X[2Xcalcnicegens[102X( [3Xri[103X ) [32X attribute
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  make  the  recursion  work,  we  have  to  acquire preimages of the nice
  generators  in  factor  groups  under the homomorphism found. But we want to
  keep  the  information,  how  the nice generators were found, locally at the
  node  where they were found. This attribute solves this problem of acquiring
  preimages  in  the  following  way: Its value must be a function, taking the
  recognition  info  record  [3Xri[103X  as  first  argument,  and  a list [3Xoriggens[103X of
  preimages  of the original generators of the current node, and has to return
  corresponding  preimages  of  the  nice generators. Usually this task can be
  done by storing a straight line program writing the nice generators in terms
  of  the  original  generators  and  executing  this  with  inputs  [3Xoriggens[103X.
  Therefore   the   default   value   of   this   attribute  is  the  function
  [2XCalcNiceGensGeneric[102X ([14X4.2-18[114X) described below.[133X

  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Ya list of preimages of the nice generators[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the default function for leaf nodes for the attribute [2Xcalcnicegens[102X
  ([14X4.2-17[114X)  described  above.  It  does  the  following:  If  the value of the
  attribute [2Xslptonice[102X ([14X4.2-21[114X) is set, then it must be a straight line program
  expressing  the  nice generators in terms of the original generators of this
  node.  In that case, this straight line program is executed with [3Xoriggens[103X as
  inputs  and  the  result is returned. Otherwise, [3Xoriggens[103X is returned as is.
  Therefore  a  leaf  node  just  has to do nothing if the nice generators are
  equal  to  the  original  generators, or can simply store the right straight
  line program into the attribute [2Xslptonice[102X ([14X4.2-21[114X) to fulfill its duties.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  following three attributes are concerned with the administration of the

  [33X[0;0YThe value of this mutable attribute is a list of generators of the kernel of
  the  homomorphism  found  at the node [3Xri[103X. It is initialised as an empty list
  when the recursive recognition function starts. Successful find homomorphism
  methods  may  append generators of the kernel to this list if they happen to
  stumble   on  them.  After  successful  recognition  of  the  image  of  the
  homomorphism  the  main  recursive recognition function will try to create a
  few  more  generators of the kernel and append them to the list which is the
  value  of  the  attribute [2XgensN[102X. The exact behaviour depends on the value of
  the  attribute  [2XfindgensNmeth[102X  ([14X4.2-23[114X)  below. The list of generators after
  that step is used to recognise the kernel. Note that the generators in [2XgensN[102X
  have  a  memory  attached  to  them,  how they were obtained in terms of the
  original generators of the current node.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  attribute  decides  about  how  generators  of  the  kernel of a found

  components bound. The first is [10Xmethod[110X which holds a function taking at least
  one  argument [3Xri[103X and possibly more, and does not return anything. The second
  is  [10Xargs[110X  which  holds a list of arguments for the above mentioned function.
  The  real  list  of  arguments is derived by prepending the recognition info
  record to the list of arguments in [10Xargs[110X. That is, the following code is used
  to call the method:[133X

  [33X[0;0YSometimes  a  find homomorphism has information that it will be difficult to
  create generators for the kernel, for example if it is known that the kernel
  will  need  lots of generators. In that case this attribute with the default
  boolean  value [10Xfalse[110X can be set to [10Xtrue[110X. In that case, the generic recursive
  recognition  function will perform an immediate verification phase after the
  kernel  has  been recognised. This is done as follows: A few random elements
  are  created,  mapped  through the homomorphism and written as an SLP in the
  nice  generators  there.  Then  this SLP is executed with preimages of those
  nice  generators.  The quotient lies then in the kernel and is written as an
  SLP  in  terms of the nice generators of the would be kernel. If this is not
  possible,  then  probably the creation of kernel generators was not complete
  and  a  few  more kernel elements are produced and recognition in the kernel
  starts  all  over again. This is for example done in case of the [21XImprimitive[121X
  method  which  maps  onto  the  action  on a block system. In that case, the
  kernel often needs lots of generators.[133X

  [33X[0;0YA  [21Xfind  homomorphism  method[121X  has the objective to, given a group [22XG[122X, either
  find  a  homomorphism  from [22XG[122X onto a group, or to find an isomorphism, or to
  solve the constructive membership problem directly for [22XG[122X, or to fail.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  case a homomorphism is found, it has to report that homomorphism back to
  the calling recursive recognition function together with as much information
  about the kernel as possible.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  a  find  homomorphism  method  determines that the node is a leaf in the
  recognition  tree (by solving the constructive membership problem directly),
  then  it  has  to ensure, that arbitrary elements can be written in terms of
  the  nice  generators of [22XG[122X. It does so by returning a function together with
  possible extra data, that can perform this job.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf  course,  the  find  homomorphism method also has to report, how the nice
  generators were acquired in terms of the original generators.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  the  find  homomorphism  method  fails, it has to report, whether it has

  again later.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFind  homomorphism  methods  have  to  fit  into  the  framework  for method
  selection  described  in  Chapter  [14X3[114X. We now begin to describe the technical
  details  of  how a find homomorphism method has to look like and what it has
  to  do  and  what  it  is  not  allowed  to do. We first explain the calling
  convention by means of a hypothetical function:[133X

  [33X[0;0YFind  homomorphism  methods  take  two  arguments [3Xri[103X and [3XG[103X, of which [3Xri[103X is a
  recognition info record and [3XG[103X is a [5XGAP[105X group object. The return value is one
  of  the four possible values in the framework for method selection described
  in  Chapter [14X3[114X indicating success, failure, or (temporary) non-applicability.
  The  above  mentioned  additional  information  in  case  of success are all
  returned  by  changing  the  recognition info record [3Xri[103X. For the conventions
  about what a find homomorphism method has to do and return see below.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  failed or not applicable find homomorphism method does not have to report
  or  do  anything  in the recognition info record [3Xri[103X. However, it can collect
  information  and  store  it either in the group object or in the recognition
  info  record.  Note  that  for  example  it  might  be  that  a  failed find
  homomorphism method acquires additional information that allows another find
  homomorphism method to become applicable.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  not  applicable  find  homomorphism  method should find out so relatively
  quickly, because otherwise the whole process might be slowed down, because a
  find homomorphism method repeatedly ponders about its applicability. Usually
  no big calculations should be triggered just to decide applicability.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA successful find homomorphism method has the following duties:[133X
  
  [8Xfor leaves:[108X
        [33X[0;6YFirst  it  has  to report whether the current node is a leaf or not in
        the recognition tree. That is, in case a leaf was found the method has
        to  do  [10XSetFilterObj(ri,IsLeaf);[110X  thereby  setting  the [2XIsLeaf[102X ([14X4.2-3[114X)
        flag.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YIf  the  method  for  some reason chooses to finish the tree below the
        current node on its own, it can set the component [10Xdonotrecurse[110X to [10Xtrue[110X
        (see  [14X4.2-33[114X)  to  indicate  that no further action is required by the
        generic  recognition  function.  The  method  is  then responsible for
        correctly  setting the [2XIsLeaf[102X ([14X4.2-3[114X) and [2XIsReady[102X ([14X4.2-4[114X) flags in the
        whole subtree.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YA  method finding a homomorphism which is not an isomorphism indicates
        so by not touching the flags.[133X
  
  [8Xfor leaves: [2XSLPforElement[102X ([14X4.2-14[114X) function[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  a  find homomorphism method has produced a leaf in the recognition
        tree  or has set the [10Xdonotrecurse[110X component to [10Xtrue[110X (see [14X4.2-33[114X), then
        it  has to set the attribute [2Xslpforelement[102X ([14X4.2-13[114X) to a function like
        [2XSLPforElementGeneric[102X  ([14X4.3-2[114X) that can write an arbitrary element in [3XG[103X
        as a straight line program in the nice generators of [3XG[103X. The method may
        store  additional  data  into  the recognition info record for this to
        work. It does not have to set any other value in [3Xri[103X.[133X
  
  [8Xfor leaves: information about nice generators[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  a  find homomorphism method has produced a leaf in the recognition
        tree,  then it has to report what are the nice generators of the group
        described  by  the  leaf.  To  this  end,  it has three possibilities:
        Firstly  to  do nothing, which means, that the original generators are
        the  nice  generators.  Secondly  to  store  a  straight  line program
        expressing  the  nice  generators  in terms of the original generators
        into the attribute [2Xslptonice[102X ([14X4.2-21[114X). In that case, the generic frame
        work  takes  care  of  the  rest.  The third possibility is to store a
        function  into  the value of the attribute [2Xcalcnicegens[102X ([14X4.2-17[114X) which
        can  calculate  preimages of the nice generators in terms of preimages
        of  the  original  generators.  See  the  function [2XCalcNiceGensGeneric[102X
        ([14X4.2-18[114X) for an example of such a function.[133X
  
  [8Xfor non-leaves: the homomorphism itself[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  a  find  homomorphism  method  has found a homomorphism, it has to
        store it as a [5XGAP[105X homomorphism object from [3XG[103X to the image group in the
        attribute  [2XHomom[102X  ([14X4.2-6[114X).  Note that if your homomorphism changes the
        representation  (for  example  going from matrix groups to permutation
        groups),  you will have to set the attribute [2Xmethodsforfactor[102X ([14X4.2-16[114X)
        accordingly.[133X
  
  [8Xfor non-leaves: kernel generators[108X
        [33X[0;6YIf  a  find  homomorphism  method  has found a homomorphism, it has to
        provide information about already known generators of the kernel. This
        is  done  firstly  by  appending known generators of the kernel to the
        attribute  value of [2XgensN[102X ([14X4.2-22[114X) and secondly by leaving or changing
        the attribute [2XfindgensNmeth[102X ([14X4.2-23[114X) to a record describing the method
        that  should  be used (for details see [2XfindgensNmeth[102X ([14X4.2-23[114X)). If one
        does  not change the default value, the recursive recognition function
        will generate 20 random elements in [3XG[103X and produce random generators of
        the   kernel  by  dividing  by  a  preimage  of  an  image  under  the
        homomorphism.  Note  that  generators in [2XgensN[102X ([14X4.2-22[114X) have to have a
        memory  attached  to them that stores, how they were acquired from the
        generators of [3XG[103X.[133X
  
  [8Xadditional information[108X
        [33X[0;6YA  find  homomorphism  method  may  store any data into the attributes
        [2Xforkernel[102X  ([14X4.2-29[114X)  and  [2Xforfactor[102X  ([14X4.2-30[114X), which both are records.
        Components  in these record that are bound during the recognition will
        be  copied  into  the recognition info record of the kernel and factor
        respectively  of  a  found  homomorphism  upon  creation  and thus are
        available  to  all find homomorphism methods called for the kernel and
        factor.  This  feature  might  be interesting to transport information
        that  is  relevant for the recognition of the kernel or factor and was
        acquired during the recognition of [3XG[103X itself.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YA  special  role is played by the component [10Xhints[110X in both of the above

  It  first  maps  [3Xx[103X  via  the  homomorphism  to  [22XH[122X  and  uses the recognition
  information  there  to  write  it as a straight line program in terms of the
  nice  generators  of  [22XH[122X.  Then  it applies this straight line program to the
  preimages  of those nice generators (see [2Xpregensfac[102X ([14X4.2-8[114X)) thereby finding
