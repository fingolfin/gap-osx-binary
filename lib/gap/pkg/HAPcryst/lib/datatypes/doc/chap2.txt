  [1X2.1 Representation-Independent Access Methods[0X
  
  All  methods listed below take a [10XHapResolution[0m in any representation. If the
  other  arguments  are  compatible with the representation of the resolution,
  the  returned  value  will be in the form defined by this representation. If
  the other arguments are in a different representation, [5XGAP[0ms method selection
  is  used  via  [10XTryNextMethod()[0m  to  find  an  applicable  method (a suitable
  representation).
  
  The  idea behind this is that the results of computations have the same form
  as  the  input.  And  as  all representations are sub-representations of the
  [10XHapResolutionRep[0m   representation,   input  which  is  compatible  with  the
  [10XHapResolutionRep[0m representation is always valid.
  
  Every new representation must support the functions of this section.

  The   large   group  representation  has  one  additional  component  called
  [10Xgroupring[0m.  Elements of the modules in a resolution are represented by lists
  of  group ring elements. The length of the list corresponds to the dimension
  of the free module.
  
  All  methods for the generic representation do also work for the large group
  representation.  Some of them are wrappers for special methods which do only
  work  for  this representation. The following list only contains the methods
  which are not already present in the generic representation.
  
  Note  that  the  input or the output of these functions does not comply with
  the standard representation.
