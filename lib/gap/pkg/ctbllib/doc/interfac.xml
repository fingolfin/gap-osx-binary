<Heading>Admissible Names for Character Tables in <Package>CTblLib</Package>
</Heading>

When you access a character table from the &GAP; Character Table Library,
this table is specified by an admissible name.

<P/>

Admissible names for the <E>ordinary character table</E> <M>tbl</M> of
the group <M>G</M> are
<List>
<Item>
  an &ATLAS; like name if <M>tbl</M> is an &ATLAS; table
  (see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:ATLAS Tables"/>), for example
  <C>"M22"</C> for the table of the Mathieu group <M>M_{22}</M>,
  <C>"L2(13).2"</C> for <M>L_2(13):2</M>, and
  <C>"12_1.U4(3).2_1"</C> for <M>12_1.U_4(3).2_1</M>.
  <P/>
  (The difference to the name printed in the &ATLAS; is
  that subscripts and superscripts are omitted except if they are used to
  qualify integer values,
  and double dots are replaced by a single dot.)
</Item>
<Item>
  the names that were admissible for tables of <M>G</M> in the
  &CAS; system
  if the &CAS; table library contained a table of
  <M>G</M>, for example <C>sl42</C> for the table of the alternating
  group <M>A_8</M>.
  <P/>
  (But note that the ordering of rows and columns of the &GAP; table may be
  different from that in &CAS;,
  see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:CAS Tables"/>.)
</Item>
<Item>
  some <Q>relative</Q> names, as follows.
  <List>
  <Item>
    If <M>G</M> is the <M>n</M>-th maximal subgroup (in decreasing group
    order) of a group whose library table <M>subtbl</M> is available in &GAP;
    and stores the <Ref Func="Maxes"/> value,
    and if <C>name</C> is an admissible name for <M>subtbl</M>
    then <C>name</C>M<M>n</M> is admissible for <M>tbl</M>.
    For example, the name <C>"J3M2"</C> can be used to access the second
    maximal subgroup of the sporadic simple Janko group <M>J_3</M>
    which has the admissible name <C>"J3"</C>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    If <M>G</M> is a nontrivial Sylow <M>p</M> normalizer in a sporadic
    simple group with admissible name <C>name</C>
    &ndash;where nontrivial means that <M>G</M> is not isomorphic to a
    subgroup of <M>p:(p-1)</M>&ndash;
    then <C>name</C>N<M>p</M> is an admissible name of <M>tbl</M>.
    For example, the name <C>"J4N11"</C> can be used to access the table
    of the Sylow <M>11</M> normalizer in the sporadic simple Janko group
    <M>J_4</M>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    In a few cases, the table of the Sylow <M>p</M>-subgroup of <M>G</M>
    is accessible via the name <C>name</C>Syl<M>p</M> where <C>name</C>
    is an admissible name of the table of <M>G</M>.
    For example, <C>"A11Syl2"</C> is an admissible name for the table of
    the Sylow <M>2</M>-subgroup of the alternating group <M>A_{11}</M>.
  </Item>
  <Item>
    In a few cases, the table of an element centralizer in <M>G</M> is
    accessible via the name <C>name</C>C<M>cl</M>
    where <C>name</C> is an admissible name of the table of <M>G</M>.
    For example, <C>"M11C2"</C> is an admissible name for the table of an
    involution centralizer in the Mathieu group <M>M_{11}</M>.
  </Item>
  </List>
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
The recommended way to access a <E>Brauer table</E> is via applying the
<K>mod</K> operator to the ordinary table and the desired characteristic
(see <Ref Func="BrauerTable" BookName="ref"/> and
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Operators for Character Tables" BookName="ref"/>),
so it is not necessary to define admissible names of Brauer tables.
<P/>
A <E>generic character table</E>
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sec:generictables"/>) is
accessible only by the name given by its
<Ref Attr="Identifier" Label="for character tables" BookName="ref"/>
value.

<Heading>The Interface to the <Package>TomLib</Package> Package</Heading>

The &GAP; Character Table Library contains ordinary character tables of all
groups for which the <Package>TomLib</Package> package <Cite Key="TomLib"/>
contains the table of marks.
This section describes the mapping between these character tables and their
tables of marks.

<P/>

If the <Package>TomLib</Package> package is not loaded then
<Ref Attr="FusionToTom"/> is the only available function from this section,
but of course it is of little interest in this situation.

<Section Label="sect:tblgrp">
<Heading>The Interface to &GAP;'s Group Libraries</Heading>

Sometimes it is useful to extend a character-theoretic computation
with computations involving a group that has the character table in question.
For many character tables in the &GAP; Character Table Library,
corresponding groups can be found in the various group libraries that are
distributed with &GAP;.
This section describes how one can access the library groups that belong
to a given character table.

<Section Label="sec:duplicates">
<Heading>Duplicates of Library Character Tables</Heading>

It can be useful to deal with different instances of <Q>the same</Q>
character table.
An example is the situation that a group <M>G</M>, say,
contains several classes of isomorphic maximal subgroups that have
different class fusions;
the attribute <Ref Attr="Maxes"/> of the character table of <M>G</M>
then contains several entries that belong to the same group,
but the identifiers of the character tables are different.

<P/>

On the other hand, it can be useful to consider only one of the different
instances when one searches for character tables with certain properties,
for example using <Ref Func="OneCharacterTableName"/>.

<P/>

<Index>duplicate character table</Index>
For that, we introduce the following concept.
A character table <M>t_1</M> is said to be a <E>duplicate</E>
of another character table <M>t_2</M> if the attribute
<Ref Attr="ConstructionInfoCharacterTable"/> is set in <M>t_1</M>,
if the first entry of the attribute value is <C>"ConstructPermuted"</C>,
and if the second entry of the attribute value is the
<Ref Attr="Identifier" Label="for character tables" BookName="ref"/> value
of <M>t_2</M>.
We call <M>t_2</M> the <E>main table</E> of <M>t_1</M>.

<Heading>Attributes for Library Character Tables</Heading>

This section describes certain attributes which are set only for certain

character tables from the &GAP; Character Table Library.
The attribute values are part of the database,
there are no methods for <E>computing</E> them.

<P/>

Other such attributes and properties are described in manual sections

These attributes are <Ref Attr="FusionToTom"/>,
