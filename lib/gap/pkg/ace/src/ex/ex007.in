# The following shows how one can approximate one of the
# even-numbered Sims strategies by causing ACE to stop
# every so often, standardising and continuing. Here, we
# use restrictive values of max to cause ACE to stop.

# We emulate Sims' 4th strategy by using ACE's sims:3
# We do Sims' Example 5.2, emulating Sims' 4th strategy 
# by using ACE's sims:3 

# From Table 5.5.3, Sims' t/m statistics are: 393/393

# Stepping max by 60 from 14 also works.

# Note: starting with max:64 and stepping by 80 only needs
# 352 (total/maximum no. of) cosets ... better than Sims.
