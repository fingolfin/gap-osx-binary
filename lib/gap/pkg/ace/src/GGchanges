Below we list the changes made to this src directory from that
supplied by Colin Ramsay and George Havas.

  postproc.c . . . . . Function al2_normcl was modified. The word 
                       `normalise' was used wrongly. The comments
                       were modified and the printed output adjusted.

                     - The words `the non-normalising conjugates' 
                       previously on lines 297-298 were changed to
                       `conjugates of subgroup generators by group 
                       generators that cannot be traced to the subgroup'.
                     - The words `g/G normalise w' previously on 
                       line 303 were replaced with `gwG and Gwg are in 
                       the subgroup'. 
                     - The word `non-normalising' previously on line 309 
                       was replaced with `added'.
                     - The words `non-normalising combo.' previously on
                       line 345 were replaced with `conjugate that's not in
                       the subgrp.'
                     - The words `one non-normalised' previously on
                       line 347 were replaced with `1 conjugate not in sgp'. 
                     - In the fprintf statements previously on lines 
                       352 and 359, the words `Grp gen'r' were replaced
                       by `Conjugate by grp gen'r' and `does not normalise'
                       was replaced by `of'. (Slightly cumbersome but
                       this way the variables keep the order they had
                       before.)
                     - The words `not in subgrp' were added before \n in the 
                       fprintf statement previously on line 370.

  ex/ex000.in  . . . . `sr:2;' line added.
     ex007.in  . . . . New input file that demonstrates using `standard'
                       and `sims:3' to approximate Sims strategy 4.
GAP also has:

  Makefile.in  . . . . Formed from the make.*** files.
