# On some machines, ACE 3.000 would die with a segmentation fault when trying
# to construct coset representatives.  Since the code seemed OK, and the
# problem only manifested itself on some Linux/gcc combinations, it was put
# down to a compiler bug (emails to/from Greg Gamble, Aug 2000).  In fact, it
# seems that this problem may have been due to an uninitialised variable
# which only manifested itself in some circumstances (emails to/from Volker
# Gebhardt, Dec 2000, and the Changes file entry for 22 Dec).

# The examples below illustrate this fault, if it's present.  Note that they
# all contain a CT row > 1 whose first entry <= row is row itself.  It is the
# building of a coset rep for this row, either via a call to `pr' with -ve
# argument or a call to `oo', which causes the problem.  The offending
# entries are CT(3,b), CT(11,a) & CT(7,a) respectively.
