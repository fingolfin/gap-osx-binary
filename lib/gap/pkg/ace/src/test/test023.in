# In ACE 3.000, the (re)setting of maxrow from maxrow1 in al1_start() in
# control.c was awry.  Setting maxrow for a redo/continue with maxrow<nextdf 
# caused it to be `rounded up' to nextdf.  If nextdf = maxrow+1 = tabsiz+1 
# from the previous run, this is past the end of the table.  Depending on
# the machine/OS/compiler, this could cause a crash.  See email to/from 
# Volker Gebhardt, Feb 2001.
#
# On older versions of ACE, the attempt to set Max:160 would be rounded
# up to one past the current size (ie, 165), which is too big.  Newer
# versions round up Max:160 to only 164.
