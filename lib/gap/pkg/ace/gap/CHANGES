##  More properly, this should properly be called `HISTORY'. Here, I  give  a
##  brief history of the evolution of the ACE share package, mainly  so  that
##  Alexander Hulpke and George Havas know what happened to various  elements
##  of the original ACE  share  package,  but  maybe  there  are  others  who
##  remember early pre-release versions of the package too.

Changes up to Version 3.0 (that is, the pre-release history):
------------------------------------------------------------
The very first version of the ACE share package was written by  Alexander
Hulpke. It was released as a pre-package at the time of GAP 4.1.

Later, but still at the time  of  GAP  4.1,  Greg  Gamble  rewrote  parts
dealing  with  the  way  the  share  package  dealt  with   options   (or
`parameters' in the language of the  stand-alone  manual),  so  that  the
order in which options were passed to ACE  was  retained,  in  the  cases
where this was important.

Then GAP 4.2 was released which provided the ``iostream'' functions,  for
the first time, which made it possible to start up an ACE binary  process
and interact with it, i.e. one could truly interact with the ACE binary's
Level 2 interface. Previously, one could only construct a script file, do
an `Exec' from within GAP that started an ACE binary process outside  GAP
which obtained the input from the script file and directed the output  to
another file. Armed with this  new  capability,  Greg  Gamble  wrote  new
`interactive' equivalents of the ACE binary's  commands.  At  about  this
time a number of commands/variable/options of Alexander Hulpke's original
ACE share package were deprecated; they are:

  `CallACE'         : now use `ACECosetTable' or `ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels'

  option `outfile'  : now use option `aceinfile'

  option `messfile' : use use option `aceoutfile'

  `ACEinfo' record  : replaced by the `ACEData' record
                      ... this change was made because a new `InfoClass',
                      namely `InfoACE', was added (and it was thought too
                      confusing to have both it and `ACEinfo')

A directory with the standalone documentation that used to be called

   ../acedoc

is now called

   ../standalone-doc

(the former name didn't differentiate it enough from ../doc),  and  there
are changes to Colin Ramsay's originals there too; but read  the  CHANGES
in that directory if you want to know about those.

Soon after the release of GAP 4.2, an initial idea of Greg  Gamble's  for
providing ACE examples,  was  scrapped  in  favour  of  the  `ACEExample'
function i.e. various `ACEexample<XXX>' functions contained in the files

   example.gd
   example.gi

(which are no longer part of the ACE  share  package)  were  replaced  by
providing the files in the

   ../examples

directory, which are read by the `ACEExample' function.

In readiness for GAP 4.3, options `semilenlex' and `lenlex'  were  added.
In GAP 4.2, the default scheme for standard numbering  of  cosets  is/was
`semilenlex', whereas in GAP 4.3 it is/will be `lenlex'. The  manual  has
the details. While the ACE share package is no longer GAP 4.1  compatible
(too much iostream functionality was added for the interactive  functions
to make GAP 4.1-compatibility a useful  consideration),  it  is  GAP  4.2
compatible but has been developed for GAP 4.3.

On 22 December 2000, an annoying bug in the ACE source code  was  finally
diagnosed and in February 2001 was fixed. At that time a message from the
ACE binary which wasn't correct Group Theory  terminology  was  adjusted.
Again, read the CHANGES in

   ../src

if you're interested in the details.

In March  2001,  the  `ACEExample'  default  function  was  changed  from
`ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels' to `ACEStats' (this way the default output
is, in general, short).

On 18 March 2001, the function `ACEVersion' was renamed `ACEBinaryVersion'
and `ACEPackageVersion' was added (the latter gives the version number of
the GAP code part).

By the way, the initial numbering (Alex Hulpke's version  didn't  have  a
number) of the ACE share package as 3.0 was a faux  pas  by  Greg  Gamble
(but one can't go backwards with the numbering, now).

Of course, that's not the end of the story, other things have been  added
along the way, including e.g. `ACEReadResearchExample' and the

   ../res-examples

directory, but it was not the purpose of this file to document additions;
the idea was that things  that  behave  or  are  named  differently  from
earlier versions or no longer exist, should be documented here.
