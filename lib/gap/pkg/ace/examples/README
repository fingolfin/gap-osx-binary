The  examples  in  this  directory  are  designed  to  work  with  the
ACEExample function ... though the following  sequence,  for  example,
will also work (after the  ACE  Share  Package  has  been  loaded  via
`RequirePackage("ace");'):

  file := Filename(DirectoriesPackageLibrary("ace", "examples"), "A5");
  ACEfunc := ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels;
  ReadAsFunction(file)();

(In the above example, one may of course substitute for "A5",  one  of
the other example filenames in this directory, and one may  substitute
ACEStats or ACEStart for ACECosetTableFromGensAndRels.)

The `magic' behind ACEExample depends on the example files having  the
following properties:

1. There is a local variables line: `local' appears flush left on this
   line, and all local variables appear on this *one* line.

2. There is a `return ACEfunc'  line,  and  `return  ACEfunc'  appears
   flush left on this line.

I guess these would be bugs, but since I've  now  documented  them,  I
suppose that  makes  them  `features'.  There  is  no  restriction  on
comments. It would be nice if the general spacing and  format  of  any
new examples added, could be maintained ... and don't forget  to  list
them in "index"!!

Most of the examples are  a  direct  translation  into  GAP  of  Colin
Ramsay's test###.in files in the ../src directory.
