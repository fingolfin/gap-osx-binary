  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xuser  interface[113X  is  the  part  of the [5XGAP[105X interface that allows one to
  display information about the current contents of the database and to access
  individual  data  (perhaps  from  a  remote  server, see Section [14X4.3-1[114X). The
  corresponding  functions  are described in this chapter. See Section [14X2.4[114X for
  some small examples how to use the functions of the interface.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YExtensions  of  the [5XAtlasRep[105X package are regarded as another part of the [5XGAP[105X
  interface,  they  are described in Chapter [14X5[114X. Finally, the low level part of
  the interface are described in Chapter [14X7[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  some  of  the  examples  in  this chapter, the [5XGAP[105X packages [5XCTblLib[105X and
  [5XTomLib[105X are needed, so we load them.[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  [13Xaccessing[113X the data means in particular that it is [13Xnot[113X the aim of
  this  package  to [13Xconstruct[113X representations from known ones. For example, if
  at  least  one  permutation  representation  for  a group [22XG[122X is stored but no
  matrix   representation   in   a   positive   characteristic  [22Xp[122X,  say,  then
  [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-5[114X)  returns  [9Xfail[109X  when  it  is  asked for a
  description of an available set of matrix generators for [22XG[122X in characteristic
  [22Xp[122X,  although  such a representation can be obtained by reduction modulo [22Xp[122X of
  an integral matrix representation, which in turn can be constructed from any
  permutation representation.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.2 [33X[0;0YGroup Names Used in the [5XAtlasRep[105X[101X[1X Package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  you  access  data  via  the [5XAtlasRep[105X package, you specify the group in
  question  by  an  admissible [13Xname[113X. Thus it is essential to know these names,
  which are called [13Xthe [5XGAP[105X names[113X of the group in the following.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  a  group  [22XG[122X, say, whose character table is available in [5XGAP[105X's Character
  Table  Library,  the  admissible names of [22XG[122X are the admissible names of this
  character  table.  If  [22XG[122X  is  almost simple, one such name is the [2XIdentifier[102X
  ([14XReference: Identifier (for character tables)[114X) value of the character table,
  see [2XAccess to Library Character Tables[102X ([14XCTblLib: Access to Library Character
  Tables[114X).  This name is usually very similar to the name used in the [5XATLAS[105X of
  Finite  Groups  [CCNPW85].  For  example, [10X"M22"[110X is a [5XGAP[105X name of the Mathieu
  group [22XM_22[122X, [10X"12_1.U4(3).2_1"[110X is a [5XGAP[105X name of [22X12_1.U_4(3).2_1[122X, the two names
  [10X"S5"[110X  and [10X"A5.2"[110X are [5XGAP[105X names of the symmetric group [22XS_5[122X, and the two names
  [10X"F3+"[110X and [10X"Fi24'"[110X are [5XGAP[105X names of the simple Fischer group [22XFi_24^'[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen a [5XGAP[105X name is required as an input of a package function, this input is
  case  insensitive.  For  example,  both [10X"A5"[110X and [10X"a5"[110X are valid arguments of
  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YInternally,  for example as part of filenames (see Section [14X7.6[114X), the package
  uses  names  that  may  differ  from  the  [5XGAP[105X names; these names are called
  [13X[5XATLAS[105X-file names[113X. For example, [10X"A5"[110X, [10X"TE62"[110X, and [10X"F24"[110X are [5XATLAS[105X-file names.
  Of  these,  only  [10X"A5"[110X  is  also  a  [5XGAP[105X  name,  but  the other two are not;
  corresponding [5XGAP[105X names are [10X"2E6(2)"[110X and [10X"Fi24'"[110X, respectively.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[7Xhttp://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas[107X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  one specifies the standardization, the [22Xi[122X-th set of standard generators
  is  denoted  by  the  number [22Xi[122X. Note that when more than one set of standard
  generators  is  defined  for  a group, one must be careful to use [13Xcompatible
  standardization[113X.  For  example,  the  straight  line programs, straight line
  decisions  and  black  box  programs  in  the  database  refer to a specific
  standardization  of  their  inputs.  That  is,  a  straight line program for
  computing  generators of a certain subgroup of a group [22XG[122X is defined only for
  a  specific  set  of  standard  generators of [22XG[122X, and applying the program to
  matrix or permutation generators of [22XG[122X but w.r.t. a different standardization
  may  yield  unpredictable  results.  Therefore  the  results returned by the
  functions   described   in   this  chapter  contain  information  about  the
  standardizations they refer to.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.4 [33X[0;0YClass Names Used in the [5XAtlasRep[105X[101X[1X Package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  each  straight  line program (see [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-3[114X)) that is used to
  compute  lists  of  class  representatives,  it is essential to describe the
  classes  in  which these elements lie. Therefore, in these cases the records
  returned  by  the  function [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-3[114X) contain a component [10Xoutputs[110X
  with value a list of [13Xclass names[113X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YCurrently  we  define  these  class names only for simple groups and certain
  extensions of simple groups, see Section [14X3.4-1[114X. The function [2XAtlasClassNames[102X
  ([14X3.4-2[114X)  can  be  used to compute the list of class names from the character
  table in the [5XGAP[105X Library.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.4-1 [33X[0;0YDefinition of [5XATLAS[105X[101X[1X Class Names[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the definition of class names of an almost simple group, we assume that
  the  ordinary  character tables of all nontrivial normal subgroups are shown
  in the [5XATLAS[105X of Finite Groups [CCNPW85].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach  class name is a string consisting of the element order of the class in
  question  followed  by  a  combination  of  capital letters, digits, and the
  characters  [10X'[110X and [10X-[110X (starting with a capital letter). For example, [10X1A[110X, [10X12A1[110X,
  and  [10X3B'[110X  denote  the  class  that contains the identity element, a class of
  element order [22X12[122X, and a class of element order [22X3[122X, respectively.[133X
  
  [31X1[131X   [33X[0;6YFor  the  table  of  a  [13Xsimple[113X  group, the class names are the same as
        returned  by  the  two argument version of the [5XGAP[105X function [2XClassNames[102X
        ([14XReference:  ClassNames[114X),  cf. [CCNPW85,  Chapter  7,  Section 5]: The
        classes  are  arranged  w.r.t. increasing  element  order and for each
        element  order  w.r.t. decreasing  centralizer  order,  the  conjugacy
        classes  that  contain  elements of order [22Xn[122X are named [22Xn[122X[10XA[110X, [22Xn[122X[10XB[110X, [22Xn[122X[10XC[110X, [22X...[122X;
        the  alphabet  used  here  is potentially infinite, and reads [10XA[110X, [10XB[110X, [10XC[110X,
        [22X...[122X, [10XZ[110X, [10XA1[110X, [10XB1[110X, [22X...[122X, [10XA2[110X, [10XB2[110X, [22X...[122X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor  example,  the classes of the alternating group [22XA_5[122X have the names
        [10X1A[110X, [10X2A[110X, [10X3A[110X, [10X5A[110X, and [10X5B[110X.[133X
  
  [31X2[131X   [33X[0;6YNext we consider the case of an [13Xupward extension[113X [22XG.A[122X of a simple group
        [22XG[122X by a [13Xcyclic[113X group of order [22XA[122X. The [5XATLAS[105X defines class names for each
        element  [22Xg[122X of [22XG.A[122X only w.r.t. the group [22XG.a[122X, say, that is generated by
        [22XG[122X  and  [22Xg[122X; namely, there is a power of [22Xg[122X (with the exponent coprime to
        the order of [22Xg[122X) for which the class has a name of the same form as the
        class  names  for  simple  groups,  and  the  name  of  the class of [22Xg[122X
        w.r.t. [22XG.a[122X  is  then  obtained  from this name by appending a suitable
        number  of  dashes [10X'[110X.  So  dashed  class  names refer exactly to those
        classes that are not printed in the [5XATLAS[105X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor  example, those classes of the symmetric group [22XS_5[122X that do not lie
        in  [22XA_5[122X  have the names [10X2B[110X, [10X4A[110X, and [10X6A[110X. The outer classes of the group
        [22XL_2(8).3[122X  have  the  names  [10X3B[110X,  [10X6A[110X,  [10X9D[110X, and [10X3B'[110X, [10X6A'[110X, [10X9D'[110X. The outer
        elements  of  order  [22X5[122X  in  the group [22XSz(32).5[122X lie in the classes with
        names [10X5B[110X, [10X5B'[110X, [10X5B''[110X, and [10X5B'''[110X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YIn the group [22XG.A[122X, the class of [22Xg[122X may fuse with other classes. The name
        of  the  class  of [22Xg[122X in [22XG.A[122X is obtained from the names of the involved
        classes of [22XG.a[122X by concatenating their names after removing the element
        order part from all of them except the first one.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor  example,  the  elements  of  order  [22X9[122X  in the group [22XL_2(27).6[122X are
        contained  in the subgroup [22XL_2(27).3[122X but not in [22XL_2(27)[122X. In [22XL_2(27).3[122X,
        they  lie  in  the  classes  [10X9A[110X, [10X9A'[110X, [10X9B[110X, and [10X9B'[110X; in [22XL_2(27).6[122X, these
        classes fuse to [10X9AB[110X and [10X9A'B'[110X.[133X
  
  [31X3[131X   [33X[0;6YNow  we  define  class  names  for  [13Xgeneral upward extensions[113X [22XG.A[122X of a
        simple  group  [22XG[122X.  Each  element  [22Xg[122X  of such a group lies in an upward
        extension  [22XG.a[122X  by  a cyclic group, and the class names w.r.t. [22XG.a[122X are
        already  defined.  The  name  of  the class of [22Xg[122X in [22XG.A[122X is obtained by
        concatenating  the  names  of  the  classes in the orbit of [22XG.A[122X on the
        classes  of  cyclic  upward  extensions of [22XG[122X, after ordering the names
        lexicographically and removing the element order part from all of them
        except  the  first one. An [13Xexception[113X is the situation where dashed and
        non-dashed  class  names  appear in an orbit; in this case, the dashed
        names are omitted.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor  example,  the  classes  [10X21A[110X and [10X21B[110X of the group [22XU_3(5).3[122X fuse in
        [22XU_3(5).S_3[122X  to the class [10X21AB[110X, and the class [10X2B[110X of [22XU_3(5).2[122X fuses with
        the  involution  classes  [10X2B'[110X,  [10X2B''[110X  in  the  groups  [22XU_3(5).2^'[122X  and
        [22XU_3(5).2^{''}[122X to the class [10X2B[110X of [22XU_3(5).S_3[122X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YIt  may  happen  that  some names in the [10Xoutputs[110X component of a record
        returned by [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-3[114X) do not uniquely determine the classes
        of   the  corresponding  elements.  For  example,  the  (algebraically
        conjugate)  classes  [10X39A[110X  and  [10X39B[110X  of  the  group  [22XCo_1[122X have not been
        distinguished  yet. In such cases, the names used contain a minus sign
        [10X-[110X,  and  mean  [21Xone  of  the classes in the range described by the name
        before  and  the  name after the minus sign[121X; the element order part of
        the  name  does not appear after the minus sign. So the name [10X39A-B[110X for
        the  group  [22XCo_1[122X means [10X39A[110X or [10X39B[110X, and the name [10X20A-B'''[110X for the group
        [22XSz(32).5[122X  means  one  of the classes of element order [22X20[122X in this group
        (these classes lie outside the simple group [22XSz[122X).[133X
  
  [31X4[131X   [33X[0;6YFor  a  [13Xdownward  extension[113X  [22Xm.G.A[122X  of an almost simple group [22XG.A[122X by a
        cyclic  group  of  order  [22Xm[122X, let [22Xπ[122X denote the natural epimorphism from
        [22Xm.G.A[122X onto [22XG.A[122X. Each class name of [22Xm.G.A[122X has the form [10XnX_0[110X, [10XnX_1[110X etc.,
        where  [10XnX[110X is the class name of the image under [22Xπ[122X, and the indices [10X0[110X, [10X1[110X
        etc.  are chosen according to the position of the class in the lifting
        order  rows for [22XG[122X, see [CCNPW85, Chapter 7, Section 7, and the example
        in Section 8]).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor example, if [22Xm = 6[122X then [10X1A_1[110X and [10X1A_5[110X denote the classes containing
        the  generators of the kernel of [22Xπ[122X, that is, central elements of order

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  above  conditions  refer  only  to  the information that is
  available  without  accessing the representations. For example, if it is not
  stored  in  the  table  of  contents whether a permutation representation is
  primitive  then  this representation does not match an [10XIsPrimitive[110X condition
  in [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [21Xminimality[121X  information  is  requested  and  no available representation
  matches this condition then either no minimal representation is available or
  the     information     about     the    minimality    is    missing.    See
  [2XMinimalRepresentationInfo[102X   ([14X6.3-1[114X)  for  checking  whether  the  minimality
  information  is  available for the group in question. Note that in the cases
  where  the string [10X"minimal"[110X occurs as an argument, [2XMinimalRepresentationInfo[102X
  ([14X6.3-1[114X)  is  called with third argument [10X"lookup"[110X; this is because the stored
  information  was  precomputed  just  for  the  groups  in the [5XATLAS[105X of Group
  Representations,  so  trying  to  compute  non-stored minimality information
  (using other available databases) will hardly be successful.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe representations are ordered as follows. Permutation representations come
  first   (ordered   according   to   their   degrees),   followed  by  matrix
  representations  over  finite  fields  (ordered first according to the field
  size and second according to the dimension), matrix representations over the
  integers,  and  then  matrix representations over algebraic extension fields
  (both  kinds  ordered  according to the dimension), the last representations
  are matrix representations over residue class rings (ordered first according
  to the modulus and second according to the dimension).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  maximal  subgroups are ordered according to decreasing group order. For
  an extension [22XG.p[122X of a simple group [22XG[122X by an outer automorphism of prime order
