  [33X[0;0YThe  aim  of the [5XGAP[105XÂ 4 package [5XAtlasRep[105X is to provide a link between [5XGAP[105X and
  the  [21X[5XATLAS[105X  of  Group  Representations[121X, a database that comprises generating
  permutations  and  matrices  for  many almost simple groups, and information
  about their maximal subgroups. This database is available independent of [5XGAP[105X
  at[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[7Xhttp://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas[107X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XAtlasRep[105X  package consists of this database (see SectionÂ [14X1.1[114X) and a [5XGAP[105X
  interface  (see  SectionÂ [14X1.2[114X); the latter is extended by further information
  available via the internet (see SectionÂ [14X4.4[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis package manual has the following parts.[133X
  
  [8XA tutorial[108X
        [33X[0;6Ygives  an  overview  how the functions of the package can be used, see

        [33X[0;6Ycan be found in ChapterÂ [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [8XMore technical information[108X
        [33X[0;6Ycan  be  found  in  the  chaptersÂ [14X6[114X  (concerning  [5XGAP[105X objects that are
        introduced  by  the  package)  andÂ [14X7[114X  (concerning global variables and
        sanity checks).[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe [5XATLAS[105X[101X[1X of Group Representations[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations consists of matrices over various rings,
  permutations,  and  shell scripts encoding so-called black box programs (see
  [Nic06]  and  SectionÂ [14X6.2[114X). Many of these scripts are straight line programs
  (seeÂ [BSWW01],   [SWW00],   andÂ [14X'Reference:  Straight  Line  Programs'[114X)  and
  straight  line  decisions  (see  SectionÂ [14X6.1[114X). These programs can be used to
  compute  certain  elements  in  a  group  [22XG[122X  from  its  standard  generators
  (seeÂ [Wil96] and SectionÂ [14X3.3[114X) for example generators of maximal subgroups of
  [22XG[122X or representatives of conjugacy classes of [22XG[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations has been prepared by Robert Wilson, Peter
  Walsh, Jonathan Tripp, Ibrahim Suleiman, Richard Parker, Simon Norton, Simon
  Nickerson,   Steve   Linton,  John  Bray,  and  Rachel  Abbott  (in  reverse
  alphabetical order).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  information  was  computed  and composed using computer algebra systems
  such  as  [5XMeatAxe[105X  (seeÂ [Rin98]),  Magma  (seeÂ [CP96]),  and [5XGAP[105X (in reverse
  alphabetical  order).  Part of the constructions have been documented in the
  literature  on  almost  simple groups, or the results have been used in such
  publications, see for example the references inÂ [CCNPW85] andÂ [BN95].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf you use the [5XATLAS[105X of Group Representations to solve a problem then please
  send  a  short  email toÂ [7Xmailto:R.A.Wilson@qmul.ac.uk[107X about it. The [5XATLAS[105X of
  Group  Representations  database should be referenced with the entryÂ [ATLAS]

  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XGAP[105X  interface  to  the  [5XATLAS[105X  of  Group  Representations  consists of
  essentially two parts.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFirst,  there  is  the  [13Xuser interface[113X which allows the user to get an
        overview  of  the  contents of the database, and to access the data in
        [5XGAP[105X  format;  this  is  described in ChapterÂ [14X3[114X. Advanced users may add
        their own data to the database, this is described in ChapterÂ [14X5[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YSecond,  there  is [13Xadministrational information[113X, which covers also the
        declaration  of  [5XGAP[105X objects such as straight line decisions and black
        box  programs.  This  is  important mainly for users interested in the
        actual  implementation  (e.Â g., for modifying the package) or in using
        it  together  with  the  [10XC[110X-[5XMeatAxe[105X  standalone  (seeÂ [Rin98]); this is
        described in ChapterÂ [14X7[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YInformation  concerning  the [10XC[110X-[5XMeatAxe[105X, including the manualÂ [Rin98], can be
  found at[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  interface  and  this manual have been provided by Thomas Breuer, except
  for  the  interpreter for black box programs (see SectionÂ [14X6.2[114X), which is due
  to  Simon  Nickerson.  Comments,  bug  reports,  and hints for improving the
  interface can be sent toÂ [7Xmailto:sam@math.rwth-aachen.de[107X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in [5XAtlasRep[105X[101X[1X, Compared to Older Versions?[133X[101X
  
  
  [1X1.3-1 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.5?[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XAtlasSubgroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X) now admits also the return value of
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-5[114X)  or  the return value of [2XAtlasGroup[102X
        ([14X3.5-7[114X)  as  its first argument. The latter is implemented via the new
        attribute  [2XAtlasRepInfoRecord[102X  ([14X3.5-9[114X),  which  is  set  in the groups
        constructed by [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-7[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInformation   about   transitivity,   rank,   primitivity,  and  point
        stabilizers  of  many permutation representations is now available. If
        applicable  then  this  information appears in the records returned by
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-5[114X), it is part of the overview shown by
        [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X), and it is shown also in the data overview in
        the web, see Section [14X4.4[114X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YTwo  new  manual sections about point stabilizers have been added, see
        the sections [14X2.4-6[114X and [14X2.4-7[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YInformation   about   the  characters  afforded  by  many  matrix  and
        permutation  representations is now available. If applicable then this
        information     appears     in     the     records     returned     by
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-5[114X),  for  matrix representations it is
        part  of  the  overview  shown  by [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X), and it is
        shown also in the data overview in the web, see Section [14X4.4[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  functions  [2XCharacter[102X ([14XReference: Character (for a character table
        and   a  list)[114X),  [2XIdentifier[102X  ([14XReference:  Identifier  (for  character
        tables)[114X),    [2XIsPrimitive[102X    ([14XReference:   IsPrimitive[114X),   [2XIsTransitive[102X
        ([14XReference: IsTransitive[114X), [2XTransitivity[102X ([14XReference: Transitivity[114X), and
        [2XRankAction[102X   ([14XReference:   RankAction[114X)  are  now  supported  as  input
        conditions   in  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X),  [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X
        ([14X3.5-5[114X), etc..[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIt  is  now  possible  to  restrict the data shown by [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X
        ([14X3.5-1[114X)  to  private  or  non-private  data. Also the data returned by
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-5[114X)  can  be  restricted  to private or
        non-private data.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA  tutorial  for beginners was added to the manual, see Chapter [14X2[114X, and
        the manual was restructured.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  the  overview  shown  by  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X) and in the data
        overview  in  the  web  (see  Section [14X4.4[114X), the ordering of groups was
        improved such that, e.g., [10X"A9"[110X precedes [10X"A10"[110X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe function [2XAtlasClassNames[102X ([14X3.4-2[114X) now admits also a Brauer table as
        its  argument,  and  works  also  for  character  tables  of  bicyclic
        extensions of simple groups.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe   group  names  that  are  entered  in  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X),
        [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-5[114X), etc., are now case insensitive, and
        if  the  package  [5XCTblLib[105X is available then the admissible group names
        for  the  [5XGAP[105X  character table of the group in question can be used in
        these functions.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  order  to reduce the number of global variables, several functions
        have  been  turned  into  components  of  the  new global variable [2XAGR[102X
        ([14X7.1-5[114X).  A few of these functions had been documented in the previous
        version,  the  old  values  are  still  available  if the package file
        [11Xgap/obsolete.g[111X has been read. This file is read automatically when the
        package  gets  loaded if [10XGAPInfo.UserPreferences.ReadObsolete[110X is [9Xtrue[109X,
        see [14X'Reference: The gap.ini file'[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA  few  nicer  characters  are  used  by  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X) if
        [10XGAPInfo.TermEncoding[110X     has     the     value    [10X"UTF-8"[110X    and    if
        [10XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo.displayFunction[110X   is   different  from
        [2XPrint[102X ([14XReference: Print[114X), see SectionÂ [14X4.3-5[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YA  bug  in  the function [2XReloadAtlasTableOfContents[102X ([14X4.2-1[114X) was fixed.
        Thanks to Jack Schmidt for reporting this bug.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-2 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.4?[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  addition  to  the group orders that were added in version 1.3 (see
        Section  [14X1.3-4[114X),  also  many  orders  of  maximal  subgroups  are  now
        available.  These values occur in the records returned by [2XAtlasProgram[102X
        ([14X3.5-3[114X)  (for  the  case  of  [10X"maxes"[110X  type programs) and of the three
        argument  version of [2XAtlasGenerators[102X ([14X3.5-2[114X); now a [10Xsize[110X component may
        be bound. In these cases, the groups returned by [2XAtlasSubgroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X)
        have the [2XSize[102X ([14XReference: Size[114X) attribute set.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  information  about the number of maximal subgroups, if available,
        is now used in [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIn  many  cases,  straight  line  programs for computing generators of
        maximal  subgroups  of  a group [22XG[122X, say, can in fact be used to compute
        also  generators  of maximal subgroups of downward extensions of [22XG[122X; if
        not  then it may suffice to extend the given straight line programs by
        additional generators.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YCurrently  this  yields  more  than  [22X200[122X  new possibilities to compute
        maximal  subgroups,  this  means  a  growth  by  about [22X25[122X percent. For
        example,  all  maximal  subgroups  of  [22X12.M_22[122X  and [22X2.Fi_22[122X can now be
        accessed via [2XAtlasGenerators[102X ([14X3.5-2[114X).[133X
  
        [33X[0;6Y(Of  course this extension means only that one can access the straight
        line  programs  in  question  automatically  via the [5XGAP[105X interface. In
        principle  one  could  have  used  them  already before, by explicitly
        applying a straight line program for a factor group to generators of a
        group,  and  perhaps  adding some element in the kernel of the natural
        epimorphism.)[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YFor  this  feature,  information  about  the compatibility of standard
        generators of groups and their factor groups was added.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  bibliographies  contained in the [5XATLAS[105X of Finite Groups [CCNPW85]
        and  in the [5XATLAS[105X of Brauer Characters [JLPW95] are now available, see
        [2XBrowseBibliographySporadicSimple[102X ([14X3.6-2[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  [5XGAP[105X  package  [5XBrowse[105X  (see  [BL11])  is  loaded  then the new
        functions           [2XBrowseMinimalDegrees[102X          ([14X3.6-1[114X)          and
        [2XBrowseBibliographySporadicSimple[102X    ([14X3.6-2[114X)   are   available;   these
        functions  can  be  called  also  by  choosing  the corresponding menu
        entries    of    the   [5XBrowse[105X   application   [2XBrowseGapData[102X   ([14XBrowse:
        BrowseGapData[114X).[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  function  [2XAtlasGroup[102X  ([14X3.5-7[114X) now admits also the return value of

  [1X1.3-3 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.3.1?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  version  was  mainly  released in order to fix a few problems. Now one
  does not get warnings about unbound variables when the package is loaded and
  the  [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X [Neu11] is not available, and pathological situations in
  [2XFFMatOrPermCMtxBinary[102X  ([14X7.3-5[114X)  (concerning  extremely  short corrupted data
  files  and  different  byte  orderings  in  binary  files)  are handled more
  carefully.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBesides this, the two functions [2XAtlasGroup[102X ([14X3.5-7[114X) and [2XAtlasSubgroup[102X ([14X3.5-8[114X)
  were  introduced,  and  the  extended function [2XQuaternionAlgebra[102X ([14XReference:
  QuaternionAlgebra[114X)  of  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4.10 can now be used for describing base rings
  in [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-5[114X) and [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X ([14X3.5-6[114X).
  (This  is  the  reason  why  this  version  of the package requires at least
  version 4.4.10 of [5XGAP[105X.)[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-4 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.3?[133X[101X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  database  was extended, see SectionÂ [14X4.3-4[114X for the number and size

  [30X    [33X[0;6YNew data types and corresponding [5XGAP[105X objects have been introduced, for
        representing   semi-presentations,  presentations,  and  programs  for
        finding  standard  generators.  For details, see [2XAtlasProgram[102X ([14X3.5-3[114X),

  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe   records  returned  by  the  functions  [2XAtlasGenerators[102X  ([14X3.5-2[114X),

        ([14X3.5-6[114X)  now contain the name and (if known) the order of the group in
        question,  and  also  components  describing the degree in the case of
        permutation  representations or the dimension and the base ring of the
        natural module in the case of matrix representations.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFor  many  of  the  groups,  information  about  the minimal degree of
        faithful  permutation  representations  and  the minimal dimensions of
        faithful   matrix   representations   in  various  characteristics  is
        available   for  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X  ([14X3.5-1[114X),  [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X

        For  these  functions,  also properties such as [2XIsPrimeInt[102X ([14XReference:
        IsPrimeInt[114X)  can  be  used to describe the intended restriction of the
        output.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOne   can   now   use   [2XPager[102X   ([14XReference:  Pager[114X)  functionality  in

        [33X[0;6YAn  interactive alternative to [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X) is provided by
        the  function  [2XBrowseAtlasInfo[102X  ([14XBrowse: BrowseAtlasInfo[114X) from the new
        (recommended) [5XGAP[105X package [5XBrowse[105X [BL11].[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe      functions      [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X      ([14X3.5-5[114X)     and
        [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X  ([14X3.5-6[114X)  now  admit  also  a list of group
        names as the first argument.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  functions  for actually accessing the data are more flexible now,
        see SectionÂ [14X4.3-6[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFor  transferring  remote  data, the [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X [Neu11] can now be
        used   (and   is   recommended)   as   an  alternative  to  [11Xwget[111X,  see
        SectionÂ [14X4.3-3[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  address  of  the data server has changed. Since the access to the
        server  is no longer possible via [11Xftp[111X, the mechanim used up to version
        1.2, which was based on [11Xftp[111X, had to be rewritten.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YThe  main consequence of this change is that information about updates
        of  the  table  of contents is now provided at the package's homepage.
        This  means that on the one hand, now package users cannot [13Xcompute[113X the
        table of contents directly from the server data, but on the other hand
        the  update  information  can  be  [13Xdownloaded[113X without the necessity to
        install [11Xperl[111X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YAnother consequence is that the system program [11Xls[111X is no longer needed,
        see SectionÂ [14X1.3-6[114X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe package manual has been restructured, extended and improved. It is
        now based on the package [5XGAPDoc[105X [LN11].[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-5 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.2?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YNot much.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe release of VersionÂ 1.2 became necessary first of all in order to provide
  a   package   version   that   is   compatible   with  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4,  since  some
  cross-references into the [5XGAP[105X Reference Manual were broken due to changes of
  section  names.  Additionally,  several web addresses concerning the package
  itself were changed and thus had to be adjusted.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis opportunity was used[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  upgrade  the  administrational part for loading the package to the
        mechanism that is recommended for [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  extend  the  test  suite, which now covers more consistency checks
        using the [5XGAP[105X Character Table LibraryÂ [Bre04],[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  make  the function [2XScanMeatAxeFile[102X ([14X7.3-1[114X) more robust, due to the
        fact  that the [5XGAP[105X function [2XPermList[102X ([14XReference: PermList[114X) now returns
        [9Xfail[109X instead of raising an error,[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yto  change  the way how representations with prescribed properties are
        accessed  (the  new  function [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X ([14X3.5-5[114X) is now
        preferred     to     the     former     [10XOneAtlasGeneratingSet[110X,     and
        [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X  ([14X3.5-6[114X) has been added in order to provide
        programmatic  access  in  parallel  to the human readable descriptions
        printed by [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X ([14X3.5-1[114X)),[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Yand last but not least to include the current table of contents of the
        underlying database.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  [5XAtlasRep[105X  users, the new feature of [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.4 is particularly interesting
  that due to better kernel support, reading large matrices over finite fields
  is now faster than it was in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3-6 [33X[0;0YWhat's New in Version 1.1?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  biggest change w.r.t.Â VersionÂ 1.1 is the addition of private extensions
  (see  ChapterÂ [14X5[114X).  It  includes a new [21Xfree format[121X for straight line programs
  (see  SectionÂ [14X5.2[114X).  Unfortunately, this feature requires the system program
  [11Xls[111X,  so  it  may  be  not  available  for example under MS Windows operating
  systems. [But see SectionÂ [14X1.3-4[114X.][133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn order to admit the addition of other types of data, the implementation of
  several functions has been changed. Data types are described in SectionÂ [14X7.5[114X.
  An  example  of  a  new  data  type  are  quaternionic  representations (see
  SectionÂ [14X7.6[114X). The user interface itself (see ChapterÂ [14X3[114X) remained the same.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  an alternative to [10Xperl[110X, one can use [10Xwget[110X now for transferring data files
  (seeÂ [14X4.3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YData  files can be read much more efficiently in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 than in [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.2. In
  VersionÂ 1.1  of  the  [5XAtlasRep[105X  package,  this  feature  is used for reading
  matrices  and  permutations  in  [5XMeatAxe[105X  text  format  with [2XScanMeatAxeFile[102X
  ([14X7.3-1[114X).  As  a  consequence,  (at  least)  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.3 is required for [5XAtlasRep[105X
  VersionÂ 1.1.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe     new     [10Xcompress[110X     component     of     the     global    variable
  [2XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo[102X  ([14X7.1-6[114X)  allows  one  to  store  data files
  automatically in [11Xgzip[111Xped form.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  matrix  representations  in  characteristic  zero,  invariant forms and
  generators for the centralizer algebra are now accessible in [5XGAP[105X if they are
  contained  in  the  source  files  --this  information  had  been ignored in
  VersionÂ 1.0 (seeÂ [2XAtlasOfGroupRepresentationsTestTableOfContentsRemoteUpdates[102X
  ([14X4.2-4[114X) for necessary updates).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAdditional information is now available via the internet (seeÂ [14X4.4[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe update facilities have been extended (seeÂ [14X4.2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  manual  is  now  distributed  also in pdf and HTML format; on the other
  hand, the PostScript format manual is no longer contained in the archives.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YApart  from these changes, a few minor bugs in the handling of [5XMeatAxe[105X files
  have  been  fixed,  typos  in the documentation have been corrected, and the
  syntax checks for [5XATLAS[105X straight line programs (seeÂ [14X7.4[114X) have been improved.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YAcknowledgments[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  perl  script  that  had  been  used  for  fetching  remote  data  until
  versionÂ 1.2  had  been  kindly  provided by Frank LÃ¼beck and Max NeunhÃ¶ffer.
  Thanks  also  to  Greg  Gamble  and  Alexander  Hulpke  for  technical hints
  concerning [21Xstandard[121X perl.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUlrich Kaiser helped with preparing the package for MS Windows.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe idea to support private extensions of the package (see ChapterÂ [14X5[114X) is due
  to  Klaus  Lux.  He  used a preliminary version of [5XAtlasRep[105X VersionÂ 1.1, and
  helped to fix several bugs.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   functions   [2XCMtxBinaryFFMatOrPerm[102X  ([14X7.3-4[114X)  and  [2XFFMatOrPermCMtxBinary[102X
  ([14X7.3-5[114X) were contributed by Frank LÃ¼beck.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XGAPDoc[105X  package  [LN11], which is used for processing the manual of the
  [5XAtlasRep[105X  package  and  for  processing  the bibliographies included in this
  package (see [2XBrowseBibliographySporadicSimple[102X ([14X3.6-2[114X)), was written by Frank
  LÃ¼beck and Max NeunhÃ¶ffer.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XGAP[105X package [5XIO[105X [Neu11], which is recommended for transferring data, was
  written by Max NeunhÃ¶ffer.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMax  has  also  suggested the generalization of the data access described in
  SectionÂ [14X4.3-6[114X,  and  the admissibility of the function [2XCharacter[102X ([14XReference:
  Character   (for   a   character   table   and  a  list)[114X)  as  a  filter  in
  [2XDisplayAtlasInfo[102X    ([14X3.5-1[114X),    [2XOneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo[102X    ([14X3.5-5[114X),    and
  [2XAllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos[102X ([14X3.5-6[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YGunter  Malle  suggested  to  make  the information about representations of
  minimal degree accessible, see SectionÂ [14X6.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAndries  Brouwer  suggested  to  add  a  tutorial,  see Chapter [14X2[114X. Klaus Lux
  suggested several improvements of this new chapter.[133X
