The rings of order p^6 are bundled into 42 descendant
files gapdec3.1, gapdec4.1 etc, named for the parents
3.1, 4.1 etc. There is also one file gap6.1 for the
elementary abelian Lie ring of order p^6.

No other Lie rings of order less than p^6 have immediate
descendants of order p^6.

The only slight confusion possible over parentage
is in the descendants of 5.42. Algebra 5.42 is a
one parameter family of Lie rings of order p^5,
but these Lie rings are all terminal except for 
one particular value of the parameter.  So if you
strip off the last class in the algebras in gapdec5.42
you get a presentation with no parameters, whereas
5.42 has a parameter.

There are three notes on the awkward cases in
restrictions on parameters.
