<h1>1 Introduction</h1><p>
<p>
A Lie <var>p</var>-ring is a nilpotent Lie ring of <var>p</var>-power order for a prime <var>p</var>. 
This package contains some algorithms for Lie <var>p</var>-rings and it gives access 
to the database of Lie <var>p</var>-rings of order at most <var>p<sup>7</sup></var> as determined by 
Mike Newman, Eamonn O'Brien and Michael Vaughan-Lee, see <a href="biblio.htm#NOV04"><cite>NOV04</cite></a> and 
<a href="biblio.htm#OVL05"><cite>OVL05</cite></a>.
<p>
<p>
For this purpose, this package introduces a datastructure for Lie <var>p</var>-rings. 
For a fixed prime <var>p</var>, this datastructure is quite similar to power-conjugate 
presentations for finite <var>p</var>-groups. The datastructure introduced here also 
allows to define Lie <var>p</var>-rings in which the presentation contains 
indeterminates. In particular, the prime <var>p</var> is allowed to be an 
indeterminate. Such Lie <var>p</var>-rings are called <em>generic</em>; they are 
described in more detail in Chapter 2 of this manual.
<p>
<p>
The package then defines for each <var>n in{1, ..., 7}</var> a (finite) list 
of generic presentations of Lie <var>p</var>-rings. For each prime <var>p geq5</var>, each 
of the generic Lie <var>p</var>-rings gives rise to a family of Lie <var>p</var>-rings over 
the considered prime <var>p</var> by specialising the indeterminates to a certain list 
of values. The resulting lists of Lie <var>p</var>-rings provides a complete and 
irredundant set of isomorphism type representatives of the Lie <var>p</var>-rings of 
order <var>p<sup>n</sup></var>. The generic Lie <var>p</var>-rings of <var>p</var>-class at most 2 can also be 
considered for the prime <var>p=3</var> and yield a list of isomorphism type 
representatives for the Lie <var>p</var>-rings of order <var>3<sup>n</sup></var> and class at most <var>2</var>.
(The <var>p</var>-class of a Lie ring is the length of the lower exponent-<var>p</var> central
series.)
<p>
<p>
The Lazard correspondence induces a one-to-one correspondence between the
Lie <var>p</var>-rings of order <var>p<sup>n</sup></var> and class less than <var>p</var> and the <var>p</var>-groups of 
order <var>p<sup>n</sup></var> and class less than <var>p</var>. This package provides a function to 
evaluate this correspondence; this function has been implemented by Willem
de Graaf. It uses the Liering package <a href="biblio.htm#CdG10"><cite>CdG10</cite></a>. 
<p>
<p>
The Lazard correspondence has been used to check the correctness of the
database of Lie <var>p</var>-rings: for various small primes it has been checked
that the Lie <var>p</var>-rings of this database define non-isomorphic finite 
<var>p</var>-groups.
