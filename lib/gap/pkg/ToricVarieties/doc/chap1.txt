  [33X[0;0Y[5XToricVarieties[105X  provides  data structures to handle toric varieties by their
  commutative algebra structure and by their combinatorics. For combinatorics,
  it  uses  the [5XConvex[105X package. Its goal is to provide a suitable framework to
  work  with  toric  varieties. All combinatorial structures mentioned in this
  manual are the ones from [5XConvex[105X.[133X
