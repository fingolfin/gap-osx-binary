  [33X[0;0YTo  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg[111X directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  default  the  [5Xorb[105X  package is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[105X when it is
  installed.  You  must  load  the package with [10XLoadPackage("orb");[110X before its
  functions become available.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  of  version 3.0, the [5Xorb[105X package has a [5XGAP[105X kernel component which should
  be  compiled. This component does not actually contain new functionality but
  will  improve  the  performance  of  AVL trees and hash tables significantly
  since many core routines are implemented in the C language at kernel level.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo compile the C part of the package do (in the [11Xpkg[111X directory)[133X
  
      cd orb
      ./configure
      make
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you installed the package in another [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X directory than the standard [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  in  your  [5XGAP[105X  4  installation,  then  you have to do two things.
  Firstly during compilation you have to use the option [10X--with-gaproot=PATH[110X of
  the [11Xconfigure[111X script where [21XPATH[121X is a path to the main [5XGAP[105X root directory (if
  not given the default [21X[11X../..[111X[121X is assumed).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSecondly  you  have to specify the path to the directory containing your [21X[11Xpkg[111X[121X
  directory  to  [5XGAP[105X's  list  of directories. This can be done by starting [5XGAP[105X
  with  the [21X[11X-l[111X[121X command line option followed by the name of the directory and a
  semicolon.  Then  your  directory  is  prepended  to the list of directories
  searched.  Otherwise the package is not found by [5XGAP[105X. Of course, you can add
  this option to your [5XGAP[105X startup script.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  installed  [5XGAP[105X  on  several  architectures,  you  must  execute the
  configure/make  step  for  each of the architectures. You can either do this
  immediately after configuring and compiling [5XGAP[105X itself on this architecture,
  or  alternatively  (when  using  version  4.5  of  [5XGAP[105X  or  newer)  set  the
  environment  variable  [10XCONFIGNAME[110X  to the name of the configuration you used
  when  compiling  [5XGAP[105X  before  running  [10X./configure[110X.  Note  however that your
  compiler  choice  and flags (environment variables [10XCC[110X and [10XCFLAGS[110X) need to be
  chosen  to  match the setup of the original [5XGAP[105X compilation. For example you
  have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly![133X
  
  
  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YRecompiling the documentation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YRecompiling  the  documentation  is possible by the command [21X[11Xgap makedoc.g[111X[121X in
  the [11Xorb[111X directory. But this should not be necessary.[133X
