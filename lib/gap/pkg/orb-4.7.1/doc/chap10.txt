  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  will  be  written  when  the [5Xchop[105X is documented and released,
  because the functions to be described here depend on that package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor the moment it should be enough to say that the functions to be described
  here  are  used to find nice quotient modules for the orbit algorithms using
  the orbit-by-suborbit techniques described in Chapter [14X9[114X.[133X
