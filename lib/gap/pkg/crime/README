This GAP package computes cohomology rings for 
finite p-groups using Jon Carlson's method, both as 
GAP objects, and also in terms of generators and 
relators. It also computes induced homomorphisms on 
cohomology and Massey products in the cohomology 
ring.

To install, download the package from
http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/crime.html
For example:
wget ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4/tar.gz/packages/crime-1.4.tar.gz

Put the package in GAP's pkg directory and unpack:
gunzip crime-1.4.tar.gz
tar xvvf crime-1.4.tar

See the documentation in the doc directory for
more information.
