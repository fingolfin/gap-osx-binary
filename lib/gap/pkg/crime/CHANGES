Changes from the 0.2 to the 0.3 versions.

  Most importantly, the function DiagonalAction
  uses a for-loop in place of the call to
  KroneckerProduct. I thought I was so clever
  for having written the entire function on one line,
  but in fact, KroneckerProduct was taking 
  up an inordinate amount of processor time.

  The same function has been renamed DownTheMiddle
  to avoid a conflict with another GAP package.

  The call to this function in lift.g on line 18
  has been replaced by a single call at the top
  of the j-loop, once per loop instead of every time.

  And I threw in a ConvertToMatrixRep at that point,
  which saves a few milliseconds.

  Changed last line in batch.g from "Print(" to "AppendTo(f".

  Added a comment to generators.gi explaining Size(H[1]).

  Changed "X" to "Indeterminate" in relations.gi

  Remarked that CohomologyRelators is *not* idempotent.
  Thus, took C!.V away from the cohomology object
  and included it as a local variable in CohomologyRelators.

  Also as a local variable in CohomologyRelators is the
  new variable IN which holds the indeterminate numbers.
  This information is kept in order to fix a bug in Intersperse.

  NiceIndeterminate was eliminated and incorporated into
  CohomologyRelators.

  CohomologyObject and CohomologyRing both test that
  G is a p-group via the TryNextMethod() mechanism.

  Added functions Inclusion and BoundaryMap.

  Added file doc/example.* which gives a better
  explanation of the usage of BoundaryMap then the
  manual.

  Wrote a slick perl script packagecrime.pl to 
  archive the package and another slick perl
  script perl.pl to print all the code without
  the comments.

  Included p as a component of the CObject to avoid all
  the calls to PrimePGroup and Characteristic.

  Took away the K argument from CohomologyObject,
  as K can be determined from M, and indeed, should
  be the same.

  Improved the argument testing in CohomologyObject.

Changes from the 1.1 version to the 1.2 version

  What was I thinking? Down the middle was eliminated,
  being ridiculously wasteful, and replaced with
  a simple for-loop.

Changes from the 1.2 version to the 1.3 version

  This file was apparently abandoned at this stage.
  Or possibly no changes were made.

Changes from the 1.3 version to the 1.4 version

  The 1.4 version was primarily introduced to comply with changes
  to package specifications in version 4.5 of GAP. In particular,
  they want the test files to cooperate with their automated
  package testing programs. Cosmetic changes
  were also performed, including and the renaming some functions
  and the removal of smarmy comments in the documentation.

  print.pl now prints comments by default.

  The PCGens function now uses GAP's SmallGeneratingSet, rather
  then construcing a minimal generating set directly.

  Combined the contents of the files order.gi, matrix.gi,
  regular.gi and betterbasis.gi into a single file called action.gi

  Made the following name changes:
  Inclusion -> SubgroupInclusion
  LiftChainMapMassey -> LiftChainMapAlternating
  ReverseLex -> ReverseLexBasis
  ChangeOfBasisMatrix -> GMinusOneBasis
  _RegularModule -> ActionOfPCGenerators
