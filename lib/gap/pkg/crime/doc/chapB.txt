  
  [1XB Leisure and Recreation: Cohomology Rings of all Groups of Size 16[0X
  
  Below  is the output of the test file [9Xtst/batch.g[0m. The file runs through all
  groups  of size n, which is initially set to 16, calls [9XProjectiveResolution[0m,
  [9XCohomologyGenerators[0m,  and [9XCohomologyRelators[0m for each group, and prints the
  results,  as well as the runtimes for each operation, to a file like the one
  shown  below.  The  runtimes  in this example have been deleted, having been
  presented  in  Appendix [14XA[0m. The example below was computed on a 2.4 GHz AMD64
  processor  with  12  GB  of  RAM. See the file [9Xtst/README[0m for suggestions on
  dealing with other users when running long-running batch processes.
