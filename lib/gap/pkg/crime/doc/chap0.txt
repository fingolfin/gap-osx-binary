  [1XAcknowledgements[0m
  This  project  would not have been possible without Jon Carlson. Jon devised
  the  algorithms  used  by  [9XProjectiveResolution[0m,  [9XCohomologyGenerators[0m,  and
  [9XCohomologyRelators[0m,  having  already  implemented  them in [5XMagma[0m, and shared
  these programs with me.
