  [1X1.1 Installation and Loading[0X
  
  Like other [5XGAP[0m packages, you download and unpack this package into [5XGAP[0m's [9Xpkg[0m
  directory.  For  example,  if  you  were  running [5XGAP[0m on some machine with a
  Unix-based  operating  system  and  [5XGAP[0m  were  installed  in  the  directory
  [9X/usr/local/gap4r5[0m then you would do the following to install [5XCRIME[0m.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ cd /usr/local/gap4r5/pkg[0X
    [4X$ su[0X
    [4X% wget ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4/tar.gz/packages/crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X% gunzip crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X% tar xvvf crime-1.4.tar[0X
    [4X[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  In  this  situation,  users  would  load  the  package  with the [9XLoadPackage[0m
  command.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ gap[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage("crime");[0X
    [4X[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Users  not  having root access, using someone else's computer, or having bad
  relationships  with  their network administrators, could install the package
  into  their  home  directories or into some other writable directory such as
  [9X/tmp[0m and load the package as follows.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ mkdir /tmp/pkg[0X
    [4X$ cd /tmp/pkg[0X
    [4X$ wget ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4/tar.gz/packages/crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X$ gunzip crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X$ tar xvvf crime-1.4.tar[0X
    [4X$ gap -l ';/tmp'[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage("crime");[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Even  simpler,  users can simply install the package in the [9X~/.gap[0m directory
  as follows.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ mkdir -p ~/.gap/pkg[0X
    [4X$ cd ~/.gap/pkg[0X
    [4X$ wget ftp://ftp.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4/tar.gz/packages/crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X$ gunzip crime-1.4.tar.gz[0X
    [4X$ tar xvvf crime-1.4.tar[0X
    [4X$ gap[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage("crime");[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Finally,  it  would  be a good idea to run the test file to confirm that all
  the  functions  work properly. This can be accomplished using [5XGAP[0m's somewhat
  obfuscated but system-independent file-manipulation commands as follows.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4Xgap> P:=PackageInfo("crime")[1];;[0X
    [4Xgap> D:=Directory(P.InstallationPath);;[0X
    [4Xgap> F:=Filename(D,"tst");;[0X
    [4Xgap> D:=Directory(F);;[0X
    [4Xgap> F:=Filename(D,"test.g");;[0X
    [4Xgap> ReadTest(F);[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  You  can  count yourself lucky if [5XGAP[0m doesn't complain about anything. There
  is  also  a  longer  running  test  file  for  those  having ample free time
  described in Appendix [14XB[0m.
  
  
  [1X1.2 For Further Information[0X
  
  The  file  [9Xdoc/example.*[0m  contains the step-by-step [5XCRIME[0m calculation of the
  cohomology ring of the quaternion group. The file [9Xdoc/explanation.*[0m contains
  a  theoretical  description  of  how  the  package  calculates  the  various
  cohomology products. Users wishing to read the source code can print all the
  programs  in the [9Xgap[0m directory with the program [9Xgap/print.pl[0m which should be
  executed in the [9Xgap[0m directory.
