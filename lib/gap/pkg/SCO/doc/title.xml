  <Abstract>This document explains the primary uses of the &SCO;
            package. Included in this manual is a documented list of
            the most important methods and functions you will
            need. For the theoretical basis of this package please
            refer to my diploma thesis and the corresponding paper
            (work in progress; <Cite Key="Goe"/>).
  </Abstract>

  <Acknowledgements>The &SCO; package would not have been possible
  without the theoretical work by I. Moerdijk and D. A. Pronk
  concerning  simplicial cohomology of orbifolds <Cite
  Key="MP_SCO"/>. Many thanks to these two, as well as Mohamed Barakat
  and the Lehrstuhl B für Mathematik at RWTH Aachen University in
  general. It should be noted that &SCO; in its current functionality
  is dependent on the &GAP; package &homalg; by M. Barakat <Cite
  Key="homalg"/>, as it relies on &homalg; to do the actual
  computations. This manual was created with the help of the &GAPDoc;
  package by M. Neunhöffer and F. Lübeck.
