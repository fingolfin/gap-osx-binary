  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YOverview over this manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X1[114X is concerned with the technical details of installing and running
  this  package.  The  following  chapter [14X2[114X explains how to use [5XSCO[105X to compute
  simplicial  (co-)homology  of  orbifolds.  For  the theoretical parts please
  refer  to  my  diploma thesis and the corresponding paper (work in progress;
  [GÃ¶r08a]).  After  this  chapter you will find some simple examples on using
  [5XSCO[105X  with  (finite) groups, manifolds, or some easy orbifolds. Also included
  in  this  manual  is  a  documented  list  of the most important methods and
  functions  you will need to work with [5XSCO[105X's data types OrbifoldTriangulation
  and SimplicialSet and to create the matrices needed for computations. Anyone
  interested   in  source  code  should  just  check  out  the  files  in  the
  [11Xgap/pkg/SCO/gap/[111X folder (--> Appendix [14XA[114X).[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation of the [5XSCO[105X[101X[1X Package[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg/[111X  directory.  By  default the [5XSCO[105X package is not automatically loaded by
  [5XGAP[105X when it is installed. You must load the package with [10XLoadPackage("SCO");[110X
  before its functions become available. Please, send me an e-mail if you have
  any questions, remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning [5XSCO[105X. Also, I would like
  to hear about applications of this package.[133X
