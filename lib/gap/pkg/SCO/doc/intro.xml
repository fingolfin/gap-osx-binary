<Heading>Overview over this manual</Heading>

Chapter <Ref Chap="intro"/> is concerned with the technical details of
installing and running this package. The following chapter <Ref
Chap="usage"/> explains how to use &SCO; to compute simplicial
(co-)homology of orbifolds. For the theoretical parts please refer to
my diploma thesis and the corresponding paper (work in progress; <Cite
Key="Goe"/>). After this chapter you will find some simple examples on
using &SCO; with (finite) groups, manifolds, or some easy
orbifolds. Also included in this manual is a documented list of the
most important methods and functions you will need to work with
&SCO;'s data types OrbifoldTriangulation and SimplicialSet and to
create the matrices needed for computations. Anyone interested in
source code should just check out the files in the
<F>gap/pkg/SCO/gap/</F> folder (&see; Appendix <Ref
Label="FileOverview"/>).
