  
  [1m[4m[31m1. The theory[0m
  
  The  [1mSophus[0m  package  was  originally designed to aid the author to classify
  some  small-dimensional  nilpotent  Lie  algebras  over  small  fields.  The
  classification follows the ideas that were used to classify small $p$-groups
  by O'Brien [O90]. The theory developed by O'Brien could easily be adopted to
  Lie  algebras,  and the details of this new theory can be found in [S]. Here
  we  only  summarise  the  main  ideas,  so  that the user can understand the
  procedures  implemented  in  this  package.  In  this  section $L$ denotes a
  finitely  generated,  and  hence  finite-dimensional, nilpotent Lie algebra.
  Suppose  that  $L$  has  nilpotency  class  $c$, and hence the lower central
  series is as follows:
  
  \[
       L= \gamma_1(L)>\gamma_2(L)=L'>\gamma_3(L)>\cdots
       >\gamma_c(L)>\gamma_{c+1}(L)=0.
  \]
  
  We  say  that  a basis $\mathcal B=\{b_1,\ldots,b_n\}$ for $L$ is [22m[36mcompatible
  with     the     lower    central    series[0m    if    there    are    indices
  $1=i_1<i_2<\cdots<i_{c}<n$  such that $\{b_{i_k},\ldots,b_n\}$ is a basis of
  $\gamma_k(L)$  for  $k\in\{1,\ldots,c\}$. We compute the structure constants
  table  with  respect  to  this  basis,  that  is,  we  compute  coefficients
  $\alpha_{i,j}^k$ for $1\leq i<j<k\leq n$ such that
  
  \[
       [b_i,b_j]=\sum_{k=j+1}^n\alpha_{i,j}^k b_k.
  \]
  
  Suppose  that  $b_i\in\gamma_j(L)\setminus\gamma_{j+1}(L)$. Then we say that
  the number $j$ is the [22m[36mweight[0m of the basis element $b_i$.
  
  Note  that in the nilpotent Lie algebra $L$ minimal generating sets have the
  same size, namely the dimension of $L/L'$. If $\dim L/L'=d$ then we call $L$
  a  $d$[22m[36m-generator  algebra[0m. We call a basis $\mathcal B$ a [22m[36mnilpotent basis[0m if
  the following hold.
  
  --    The basis $\mathcal B$ is compatible with the lower central series.
  
  --    For  each  $b_i\in  \mathcal  B$  with  weight  $w\geq  2$  there  are
        $b_{j_1},\ b_{j_2}\in\mathcal B$ with weight 1 and $w-1$, respectively
        such  that $b_i=[b_{j_1},b_{j_2}]$. The product $[b_{j_1},b_{j_2}]$ is
        called the definition of $b_i$.
  
  A  Lie  algebra $K$ is said to be a [22m[36mcentral extension[0m of $L$ if $L\cong K/I$
  for  some  ideal $I$ such that $I\leq Z(K)\cap K'$. Suppose that $c$ denotes
  the  nilpotency  class  of  $L$.  Then  a  Lie  algebra  $K$ is an [22m[36mimmediate
  descendant[0m  of $L$ if $K$ has class $c+1$ and $K/\gamma_{c+1}(K)\cong L$. As
  in this case $\gamma_{c+1}(K)\leq Z(K)\cap K'$, it follows that an immediate
  descendant  $K$  is  a central extension of $L$. If $s=\dim \gamma_{c+1}(K)$
  then $K$ is said to be a [22m[36mstep-$s$[0m immediate descendant of $L$.
  
  Let $L$ be a $d$-generator nilpotent Lie algebra with class $c$, and let $F$
  be  a  free  Lie  algebra  of rank $d$. Choose an ideal $I$ of $F$ such that
  $L\cong  F/I$. Then the Lie algebra $L^*=F/[I,F]$ is called the [22m[36mLie cover[0m of
  $L$.  The  [22m[36mLie  multiplicator[0m in $L^*$ is the subspace $I/[I,F]$ and the [22m[36mLie
  nucleus[0m  is  $\gamma_c(L^*)$.  It clear from the definition that $L^*/M\cong
  L$.  It  is  verified in [S] that, up to isomorphism, the Lie cover, the Lie
  multiplicator  and the Lie nucleus are determined by the isomorphism type of
  $L$.  Further,  each central extension of the nilpotent Lie algebra $L$ is a
  quotient  of  the  Lie  cover  $L^*$. Thus it is possible to obtain all such
  descendants by first computing the Lie cover; this procedure is explained in
  [S].  Similar  ideas  can  be  used  to  compute the automorphism group of a
  nilpotent  Lie  algebra, and to verify isomorphism between two nilpotent Lie
  algebras; see [S] for details.
  
  The main functions in [1mSophus[0m are thus able to compute
  
  --    a nilpotent basis for a nilpotent Lie algebra;
  
  --    the cover of a nilpotent Lie algebra;
  
  --    the immediate descendants of a nilpotent Lie algebra;
  
  --    the full automorphism group of a nilpotent Lie algebra.
  
  There  is  also  a  function  in  the  package to check if two nilpotent Lie
  algebras  are  isomorphic.  After  repeated  applications  of  the immediate
  descendants  algorithm, it is, in theory, possible to list all nilpotent Lie
  algebras  of  a given dimension over a prime field $\mathbb F_p$. Of course,
  this  computation  requires  relatively  large  computational resources, and
  quickly becomes unfeasible as the dimension or the characteristic $p$ grows.
  
  The  [1mSophus[0m  package  was  written for the GAP~4 computer algebra system. In
  many procedures it is very important that we can compute the stabiliser of a
  subspace  under  some  matrix  group  action.  This is carried out using the
  procedures  implemented  in  the [22m[34mautpgrp[0m package [EO]. Hence this package is
  required to run [1mSophus[0m.
  
  The current version of [1mSophus[0m deals with general nilpotent Lie algebras over
  finite  prime  fields. If you are to compute with Lie algebras obtained from
  group  algebras  via  the bracket operation, then another GAP package LAGUNA
  [VS] may also offer some very efficient methods.
