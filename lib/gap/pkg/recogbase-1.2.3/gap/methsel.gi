#############################################################################

#
# A method is described by a record with the following components:
#  method     : the function itself
#  rank       : an integer rank
#  stamp      : a string describing the method uniquely
#  comment    : an optional comment to describe the method for humans
#  
# A database of methods is just a list of such records.
#
# Data for the method selection process is collected in another record
# with the following components:
#   falsemethods  : a record where each method that did not succeed
#                   left its stamp
#   failedmethods : a record where each method that failed temporarily
#                   left its stamp
#   successmethod : the stamp of the successful method in the end
#   tolerance     : last value of tolerance counter, see below
#   result        : either fail or true
#

# A constant:
InstallValue( NotApplicable, "NotApplicable" );
