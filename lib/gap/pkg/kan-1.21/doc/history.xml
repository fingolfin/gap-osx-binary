<Section><Heading>Versions of the package</Heading>

The first version of the package, written for &GAP; 3, 
formed part of Anne Heyworth's thesis <Cite Key="anne-thesis" /> in 1999,
but was not made generally available.
<P/>
Version 0.91 was prepared to run under &GAP; 4.4.6, in July 2005.
<P/>
Version 0.94 differed in two significant ways. 
<List>
<Item>
The manual was produced using the <Package>GAPDoc</Package> package. 
</Item>
<Item>
The test file <F>kan/tst/kan_manual.tst</F> set the <C>AssertionLevel</C> 
to <C>0</C> to avoid recursion in the <Package>Automata</Package> package.
</Item>
</List>
<P/> 
Version 0.95, of 9th October 2007, 
just fixed file protections and added a <F>CHANGES</F> file. 
<P/>
Version 0.96 was required because the &kan; website moved 
with the rest of the Mathematics website at Bangor. 
<P/> 
Version 0.97, of November 18th 2008, deleted temporary fixes which were 
no longer needed once version 1.12 of <Package>Automata</Package> 
became available. 
<P/> 
Version 1.01, of August 2011, included minor changes required for &GAP; 4.5.  
In particular, the test file <F>kan_manual.tst</F> 
was replaced by the pair <F>fulltest.tst</F> and <F>parttest.tst</F>. 
<P/>
Version 1.11, of December 2014 was required when the &kan; website moved yet again.  At the same time a bitbucket repository for the package was started. 
<P/> 
&kan; became an accepted &GAP; package in May 2015. 
<P/>
The latest version is &VERSION;, released on &LONGRELEASEDATE;.

<Section><Heading>What needs doing next?</Heading>

There are too many items to list here, but some of the most important
are as follows.

<List>
<Item>
Implement iterators and enumerators for double cosets.
</Item>
<Item> 
At present the methods for <C>DoubleCosetsNC</C> and <C>RightCosetsNC</C> 
in this package return automata, rather than lists of cosets 
or coset enumerators.  This needs to be fixed.
</Item>
<Item>
Provide methods for operations such as <C>DoubleCosetRepsAndSizes</C>.
</Item>
<Item>
Convert the rest of the original &GAP; 3 version of &kan; to &GAP; 4.
</Item>
</List>

<ManSection>
   <Oper Name="DoubleCosetsAutomaton"
         Arg="G, U, V" />
   <Oper Name="RightCosetsAutomaton"
         Arg="G, V" />
<Description>
Alternative methods for <C>DoubleCosetsNC(G,U,V)</C> 
and <C>RightCosetsNC(G,V)</C> <E>should be</E> provided in the cases 
where the group <C>G</C> has a rewriting system or is known to be infinite.
At present the functions <C>RightCosetsAutomaton</C> and 
<C>DoubleCosetsAutomaton</C> return minimized automata, 
and <C>Iterators</C> for these are not yet available.
