  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XKan[105X  package started out as part of Anne Heyworth's thesis [Hey99], and
  was designed to compute induced actions of categories (see also [BH00]).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  version  of  [5XKan[105X only provides functions for the computation of normal
  forms  of representatives of double cosets of finitely presented groups, and
  is  made  available  in  support of the paper [BGHW06]. Existing methods for
  computing double cosets in [5XGAP[105X are described in [Lin91].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe package is loaded into [5XGAP[105X with the command[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe current version is 1.21 for [5XGAP[105X 4.7, released on 2nd June 2015.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package may be obtained as a compressed tar file [11Xkan-1.21.tar.gz[111X by ftp
  from  one  of the sites with a [5XGAP[105X 4 archive, or from the Bangor Mathematics
  website             pages             using             the             URL:

  [33X[0;0YSome  of  the  functions  in  the  [5Xautomata[105X package are used to compute word
  acceptors and regular expressions for the languages they accept.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5Xkbmag[105X package is also used to compute a word acceptor of a group [10XG[110X when
  [10XG[110X has no finite rewriting system. If [5Xkbmag[105X is not available (the user is not
  on  a  UNIX  system,  or  the  C-programs  have not been compiled), the file
  [11Xdckbmag.gi[111X  will  not  be  read,  so  methods  for the functions detailed in
  section 2.4.1 will not be available. The information parameter [10XInfoKan[110X takes
  default  value  [10X0[110X.  When raised to a higher value, additional information is
  printed out.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOnce  the  package  is  loaded,  it is possible to check the installation is
  correct  by  running  a  test file of the manual examples with the following
  command.  (The  test  file  itself  is [11Xtst/fulltest.tst[111X or [11Xtst/parttest.tst[111X,
  depending  whether  or  not  [5Xkbmag[105X  is available. The 'all' in the log below
  indicates that the full test has been run.)[133X
