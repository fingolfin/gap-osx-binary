                        The KAN package - version 1.21

This is the README file for the GAP package ``KAN''. 

This package was conceived as a package for computing induced actions
of categories.  This version only deals with deouble coset rewriting
systems for finitely presented groups.
A more detailed history is included as Chapter 3 of the manual.

``KAN'' became an accepted package in May 2005.
