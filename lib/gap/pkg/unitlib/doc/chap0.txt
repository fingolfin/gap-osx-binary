  [1XAbstract[101X
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XUnitLib[105X  package extends the [5XLAGUNA[105X package and provides the library of
  normalized  unit  groups of modular group algebras of all finite [22Xp[122X-groups of
  order not greater than 243 over the field of [22Xp[122X elements.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  also  contains  a  parallel  implementation  of  the  computation of the
  normalized  unit group of a modular group algebra of a finite [22Xp[122X-group (which
  should  be  retrieved from the [5XGAP[105X Small Groups Library) over the field of [22Xp[122X
  elements.[133X

  [1XAcknowledgements[101X
  [33X[0;0YThe first version of the package (as well as the subsequent version 2.1) was
  released  in  2006,  when  the  first  author  was  a  postdoctoral research
  collaborator  at  the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium. It is a pleasure
  of  the  first author to express his gratitude to Prof. Dr. Eric Jespers for
  his warm hospitality and to acknowledge the support provided by the Francqui
  Stichting grant ADSI107.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBoth  authors  are  very  grateful  to  the  members of the [5XGAP[105X team: Thomas
  Breuer,  Stefan Kohl and Frank LÃ¼beck for helpful suggestions. We would like
  to  acknowledge  Bettina Eick for communicating the package, and the referee
  for  testing  [5XUnitLib[105X  and  useful  comments.  Finally, we wish to thank the
  Centre  for  Interdisciplinary  Research  in  Computational  Algebra  of the
  University  of St Andrews and the Computational Cluster of the Kiev National
  Taras  Shevchenko  University  for  offering  their  computer facilities for
  computations.[133X
