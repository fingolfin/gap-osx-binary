<Abstract>

<Index Key="UnitLib package">&UnitLib; package</Index> 

The &UnitLib; package extends the &LAGUNA; package and provides the 
library of normalized unit groups of modular group algebras of all 
finite <M>p</M>-groups of order not greater than 243 over the field 
of <M>p</M> elements.
<P/>
It also contains a parallel implementation of the computation of the 
normalized unit group of a modular group algebra of a finite 
<M>p</M>-group (which should be retrieved from the &GAP; Small Groups 
Library) over the field of <M>p</M> elements.

<Acknowledgements>
The first version of the package (as well as the subsequent version 2.1)
was released in 2006, when the first author was a postdoctoral 
research collaborator at the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Belgium. 
It is a pleasure of the first author to express his gratitude to 
Prof. Dr. Eric Jespers for his warm hospitality and to acknowledge 
the support provided by the Francqui Stichting grant ADSI107.
<P/>

Both authors are very grateful to the members of the &GAP; team: 
Thomas Breuer, Stefan Kohl and Frank L&#252;beck for helpful suggestions. 
We would like to acknowledge Bettina Eick for communicating the package,
and the referee for testing &UnitLib; and useful comments. 
Finally, we wish to thank the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in 
Computational Algebra of the University of St Andrews and the 
Computational Cluster of the Kiev National Taras Shevchenko University
for offering their computer facilities for computations.
