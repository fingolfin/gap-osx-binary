  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YGeneral aims[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XKG[122X  be  a  group  algebra  of  a  finite  [22Xp[122X-group [22XG[122X over the field [22XK[122X of
  characteristic  [22Xp[122X,  and  let  [22XV(KG)[122X  be the normalized unit group of [22XKG[122X. The
  pc-presentation  of  the  group  [22XV(KG)[122X can be computed using the [5XGAP[105X package
  [5XLAGUNA[105X  ([7Xhttp://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/laguna/[107X),  but  for groups of
  orders 64 and more such computation will already take a lot of time.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XUnitLib[105X package is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package that is focused on
  this  problem.  It contains the library of normalized unit groups of modular
  group  algebras of finite [22Xp[122X-groups over the field of [22Xp[122X elements. This allows
  the  user to retrieve the pre-computed group from the library instead of the
  time-consuming  computation.  The  group  created with [5XUnitLib[105X will have the
  same properties and attributes as the one computed with [5XLAGUNA[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  version  [5XUnitLib[105X  3.0.0  released in May 2009 also contained a parallel
  implementation  of the computation of the normalized unit group of a modular
  group  algebra of a finite [22Xp[122X-group over the field of [22Xp[122X elements, which works
  for groups from the [5XGAP[105X small groups library. It is developed on the base of
  the  sequential  version of this algorithm (which works for any [22Xp[122X-group with
  no  limitations)  from  the  [5XLAGUNA[105X  package. Parallelisation is implemented
  using  the  [5XSCSCP[105X  package  that  is  capable of connecting several local or
  remote [5XGAP[105X instances using the [5XSCSCP[105X protocol.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn April 2012, [5XUnitLib[105X 3.1.0 was updated to comply with [5XGAP[105X 4.5.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  current  version  of  [5XUnitLib[105X  provides  the library of normalized unit
  groups [22XV(KG)[122X for all [22Xp[122X-groups of order not greater than 243.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you  need  to  work  with  groups  of bigger orders, please write to the
  maintainers, because they may be already computed or we can compute them for
  you.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YTheoretical background[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSince  the  [5XUnitLib[105X package is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package [BKRS], we
  refer to the [14XLAGUNA: LAGUNA package[114X manual for the theoretical backround. In
  particular,  Chapter  3  (The  basic  theory  behind  [5XLAGUNA[105X) of that manual
  contains  definitions  of  the modular group algebra and its normalized unit
  group, the power-commutator presentation of the group, and also more details
  about  the  algorithm  for  the  computation  of  the pc-presentation of the
  normalized unit group of a modular group algebra of a finite [22Xp[122X-group.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YInstallation and system requirements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XUnitLib[105X  3.2.0  is  designed  for [5XGAP[105X 4.5 and no compatibility with previous
  releases of [5XGAP[105X 4 is guaranteed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLibraries  of  normalized  unit  groups  of  groups of orders less than 243,
  except for the order 128, will be available in any operating system.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  library  for  groups of order 128 was compressed using the [11Xgzip[111X program
  and,  therefore,  will  be  available  only  in UNIX-type systems (including
  UNIX-installation  in  Mac  OS X and Cygwin installation in Windows). If you
  need  to  work  with  groups  of  order  128 in Windows, please write to the
  maintainer   to   request   a   version   of  [5XUnitLib[105X  with  locally  stored
  non-compressed data.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  work  with the library for groups of order 243 you will also need the [5XIO[105X
  package                  by                  Max                  Neunh√∂ffer
  ([7Xhttp://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html[107X)
  to retrieve the data from the [5XUnitLib[105X homepage.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBecause the [5XUnitLib[105X is an extension of the [5XLAGUNA[105X package, you must have the
  [5XLAGUNA[105X  package  installed.  You can obtain it from the [5XGAP[105X homepage or from
  its homepage [7Xhttp://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/laguna.htm[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  use  the [5XUnitLib[105X online help it is necessary to install the [5XGAP[105X4 package
  [5XGAPDoc[105X  by  Frank L√ºbeck and Max Neunh√∂ffer, which is available from the [5XGAP[105X
  homepage or from [7Xhttp://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/[107X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XUnitLib[105X is distributed in standard formats ([11Xtar.gz[111X, [11Xtar.bz2[111X, [11X.zip[111X, [11X-win.zip[111X)
  and    can    be    obtained    from    the    [5XGAP[105X    homepage    or    from
  [7Xhttp://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/unitlib/[107X.  To  install [5XUnitLib[105X, unpack
  its  archive into the [11Xpkg[111X subdirectory of your [5XGAP[105X4.5 installation. When you
  don't  have  access  to the directory of your main [5XGAP[105X installation, you can
  also  install  the  package  [13Xoutside  the [5XGAP[105X main directory[113X by unpacking it
  inside a directory [11XMYGAPDIR/pkg[111X. Then to be able to load [5XUnitLib[105X you need to
  call [5XGAP[105X with the [10X-l ";MYGAPDIR"[110X option.[133X
