  The  commutative  image  of  a rational language is a semilinear set, i.e. a
  finite  union  of  semilinear  sets. One may adapt the function to compute a
  rational  expression for the language recognized by an automaton in order to
  compute  directly  the  commutative  image of the language recognized by the
  automaton.  Further  improvement  leads  to  the  direct  computation of the
  closure  in  Bbb Z^n, for the profinite topology, of that commutative image.
  (See [D01] for the correction of the algorithms.) Recall that (see [D98]) if
  a  linear  set  given  by the linear expression a+b_1Bbb N+ cdots +b_pBbb N,
  then  a+b_1Bbb  Z+  cdots +b_pBbb Z is a Bbb Z-semilinear expression for the
  closure under the profinite topology of the semilinear set given. We use the
  terminology [22m[32mcommutative language[0m and [22m[32mAbelian language[0m for subsets of Bbb N^n
  and  Bbb  Z^n  respectively.  The  [22m[32mcommutative  language  recognized  by  an
  automaton[0m  is  the  commutative  image  of  the  language  recognized by the
  automaton.  The  [22m[32mAbelian  language recognized by an automaton[0m is the closure
  under  the  profinite  topology  of  the  commutative  image of the language
  recognized by the automaton.

  The  case  of  Bbb  Z-semilinear  languages is similar to that of semilinear
  languages,  but  some  more simplifications are done. Computations of normal
  forms  of  matrices  aiming  to determine basis for subgroups of Bbb Z^n are
  made.  These  computations  of  normal forms are carried out using functions
  that are part of \GAP.
