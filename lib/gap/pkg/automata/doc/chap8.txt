  The  drawing  of  graphs  described  here  uses  [22m[32m graphviz [0m , a software for
  drawing  graphs  developed  at  AT  &  T  Labs,  that  can  be  obtained at [22m[32m

  [1m[4m[31m8.1 Installing some external programs[0m
  
  If  you  work  under  [22m[32m  LINUX  [0m , you should install graphviz and create the
  directory [22m[32m ~ /dot-tmp [0m .

  This  function tests if automaton [22m[32m A [0m is a subautomaton of [22m[32m B [0m in which case
  draws  [22m[32m  B  [0m  highlighting  the edges not in [22m[32m A [0m by drawing them in a dotted
  style,  while  the  others  are drawn in a plain style and writes the needed
  data in file ~ /dot-tmp/file.

  [1m[34m> DrawSCCAutomaton( [0m[22m[34mA[, file][0m[1m[34m ) ____________________________________[0mfunction
  
  Draws  automaton  [22m[32m  A  [0m and highlights it's strongly connected components by
  drawing  their  edges  in  a  dotted  style  and their vertices in a lighter
  colour. Writes the needed data in file ~ /dot-tmp/file.
