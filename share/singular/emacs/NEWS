News up to revision 1.30
========================

* Customizing added.  There are the groups
  - singular-faces

* Section folding completely redesigned.  Uses overlays now.
  Code splitted up into Emacs and XEmacs specific foldings.

* Comint interface documented.  Old folding concerning
  customizing of Comint's variables completely removed.  History
  stuff simplified, modularized, moved to its own folding.
  Chunks of a demo file are not inserted into history unless
  user explicitly requests so.

General news
------------

* Key map and menu folding splitted.  Logo stuff (mostly
  commented) moved to menu folding.

* Faces and Font Lock mode foldings moved to Singular interactive
  mode specific code.  Syntax table folding moved to code common
  to both modes.

* Most of the foldings modularized.  That is, everything that
  belongs logically to a folding moved into it.  In particular,
  much code moved from Singular interactive mode initialization
  to foldings.

* Emacs 19 de-supported.

* Some new style and coding conventions added.
